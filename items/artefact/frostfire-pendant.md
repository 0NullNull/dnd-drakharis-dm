# Frostfire Pendant
## *Artefact* 
**Rarity:** *Legendary*
## Description  
The Frostfire Pendant allows its wearer to control both fire and ice. Once per day, the wearer can cast Wall of Ice and Wall of Fire simultaneously, merging the two into a deadly barrier that deals both fire and cold damage. The pendant also grants resistance to both fire and cold damage.
## Curse 
The conflicting nature of the pendantâ€™s magic strains the body. Each time the barrier is created, the wearer must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or gain a level of exhaustion. If the wearer dies while under the effect of exhaustion from the pendant, their body is encased in both fire and ice, petrifying them into a frozen statue that burns with eternal flame.
