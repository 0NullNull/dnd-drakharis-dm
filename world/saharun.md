# Saharun 
Saharun is a vast, sun-scorched desert where survival is a rare and precious gift. The land is barren, with only a few scattered cities and oasis towns clinging to life along its harsh borders. A harsh environment has shaped its people into a resilient breed, surviving under the oppressive heat and amidst relentless raiders and pirates. Despite its desolation, the region holds ancient secrets, for Saharun was once home to thriving civilizations—civilizations now lost to time and ruin. What remains are the remnants of their once-proud cities, now silent, weathered relics standing as ghosts of the past. Here, magic is both a necessity and a tightly controlled force, used to combat the overwhelming dangers that threaten the land. While magic is forbidden to the common folk, it is the lifeblood of the few who dare to govern these cities and guard their secrets.

In the farthest reaches, ancient, eldritch horrors may still stir, remnants of a time before the desert's reign of silence. One city stands as a rare exception: a thriving coastal hub, its prosperity a mystery, possibly tied to the eldritch forces that haunt the land. It is in this place that whispers of a greater power may hold the key to the continent’s fate.
