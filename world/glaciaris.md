# Glaciaris 
Nestled in the far north lies Glaciaris, a frozen and unforgiving land where the remnants of once-proud civilizations now fight for survival. The continent is divided by a long-standing war between two mighty nations, each struggling to claim territory in the harsh and desolate wilderness. A bitter conflict has scarred the land for centuries, and the frontlines of battle stretch across the heart of the continent, leaving a devastated, war-torn middle where only the most resilient dare to tread. The landscape itself mirrors the conflict: a brutal, icy wasteland, plagued by vicious storms, frigid temperatures, and jagged mountains.
  
Though it is not the most dangerous of the continents, Glaciaris is certainly not a place for the weak. The bitter cold and relentless fighting make survival difficult, and the people here have learned to live with constant uncertainty and fear. Magic in Glaciaris is viewed as a powerful tool, one used for war and domination, but it is not welcomed in civilian hands. Outsiders who dare to wield magic risk a swift and violent end. In the northern reaches, corruption seeps into the land, both from the environment and the consequences of prolonged conflict. The land itself bears the scars of war, with twisted, corrupted terrain marking areas where the struggle has left its deepest marks.
  
Despite the harshness of life, Glaciaris remains a place where some manage to eek out an existence, driven by a grim determination to survive. Its people, hardened by the cold and violence, value strength and perseverance above all else. And yet, even amidst the harshest conditions, whispers of something darker linger beneath the surfaceâ€”of ancient forces stirring in the frozen corners of the world.
