# Elder Tan Xin
**Race:** Human  
**Class:** Monk (Way of the Kensei)  
**Age:** Over 800 years  
## Appearance
Tan Xin is a striking figure, exuding an air of confidence and grace. He wears a flowing robe that reflects his style as a wandering warrior. His hair is long and unkempt, framing a face marked with a perpetual, playful smile. He wields a katana, its blade gleaming with an ethereal quality, and carries an aura of calm menace.
## Backstory 
Once a skilled swordsman who roamed the lands, Tan Xin became one of the revered Elders of Shengdao after pledging himself to Kytheras. He has seen countless battles and has witnessed the rise and fall of many warriors. His experiences shaped him into a monk who walks the line between peace and justice, often waiting for those who threaten the balance of the world.
## Abilities
Blessed by Kytheras, Tan Xin possesses heightened speed and agility, allowing him to move with the grace of a dancer. He can anticipate his opponents' movements and often appears to cut down foes before they even realize he has moved. He enjoys delivering justice with a menacing smile, delighting in the thrill of battle. His signature move involves drawing his katana so swiftly that it seems he merely flicked his wrist, yet his opponents find themselves cut down before they can react.
## Personality Traits 
Tan Xin has a cocky demeanor, often displaying a calm yet menacing confidence in combat. He revels in the act of delivering justice, sometimes seeming to enjoy it a bit too much. While he has a carefree attitude, he is also morally questionable, waiting for others to tip the scales of balance before acting. He often warns those he faces about the fleeting nature of power gained through fear, a lesson learned from his own past.
## Role in the Council 
As a member of the council of elders, Tan Xin serves as both a judge and executioner of those who threaten the balance. He often acts without warning, allowing potential threats to reveal themselves before swiftly dealing with them. His presence is both respected and feared, as many know that his justice is quick and without mercy.
