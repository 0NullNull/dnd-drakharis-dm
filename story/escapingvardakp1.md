# The Escape from Vardak - A Fateful Beginning  
<br>

Their journey began under the harshest of circumstances: slaves from various parts of the world, shackled and transported in a grim caravan along the desolate coast of Vardak, a war-torn land ravaged by endless conflict and despair. For what seemed like an eternity, they had been nothing but cargo—treated as little more than property, forced into servitude for masters whose names and faces remained a mystery. Their lives had been a blur of misery and humiliation, until that fateful day.  
<br>

The caravan was tightly guarded, with the sounds of clinking chains and the creaking of wooden wheels on the rough, dust-choked roads constantly reminding them of their captivity. The air always felt heavy, oppressive, the sun a constant presence in the sky, beating down on the land with unrelenting heat. The shadows cast by the trees that lined the road seemed to stretch unnaturally long, as if the very earth itself was holding its breath.  
<br>

But that morning, something felt different. The air was thick with tension. A quiet ripple of unease spread through the captives as they exchanged furtive glances. It was almost as if the world itself had paused in anticipation, holding its breath for the inevitable.  
<br>

Among the slaves, one was different. A rogue, quick-witted and daring, had always refused to accept the fate that had been thrust upon them. With a mind sharp as a blade and a hunger for freedom, the rogue had spent weeks watching, waiting for the right moment, studying the guards, learning the layout of the caravan. The shackles, cold and confining, had been a constant reminder of their imprisonment, but the rogue had never once let them break their spirit. And now, at last, the time had come.  
<br>

But the rogue had help. The tools they needed to free themselves were smuggled in by a most unlikely source: an artificer, a quiet but resourceful individual who had managed to hide a set of lockpicking tools in the most unusual of places—his exceptionally magnificent beard. The rogue had learned of this hidden stash during their time in the caravan, and when the moment came, they knew exactly where to look. With steady hands, they retrieved the tools, unlocking the chains that bound them.  
<br>

In a flurry of quiet but decisive action, the rogue freed the others—one by one, the cold iron of their shackles falling away. Freedom was now within reach. But there was no time to savor it.  
<br>

The tension in the air escalated, and the sound of footsteps—heavy and deliberate—grew closer. A guard, moving toward the carriage, was about to discover the broken chains. The guards had grown suspicious, noticing the subtle shift in the air, and this time, there was no way to hide it.  
<br>

Without missing a beat, the captives scrambled to make it look as though they were still shackled, their bodies contorting to fall into position once more. They forced themselves to stay still, trying to appear as helpless as they had been before—desperate to avoid suspicion. The rogue’s quick thinking held them together for a tense moment, but the guard was nearing. Their chance was slipping away.  
<br>

And then—chaos.  
<br>

Out of nowhere, wraiths—dark, shadowy creatures—materialized from the surrounding forest. Their ethereal forms billowed like smoke as they descended upon the caravan with terrifying speed and hunger. The wraiths howled through the air, their shrieks echoing off the trees as they tore into the guards with unholy fury, their cold fingers turning men into pale, ghostly shadows in an instant.  
<br>

The moment of confusion and terror was all the captives needed. The guard never saw it coming. In the chaos of the wraiths’ attack, they fled, running as fast as they could into the dense forest that stretched out before them. The caravan was now a blur behind them—no longer a prison, but a forgotten nightmare in the distance.  
<br>

They ran for days, hiding in the thick forests and hills of Vardak, where the air was always damp, and the ground beneath their feet was uneven and treacherous. The freedom they had longed for was now in their hands, but it came with a price. They had to keep moving, always a step ahead of the guards who would no doubt come looking for them. The wilderness was unforgiving, but it offered the only sanctuary they could hope for.  
<br>

Every night, they camped in hidden spots, and each day, they moved on—staying low, avoiding the roads and trails that might give them away. But the search was relentless. They could hear it—the faint but unmistakable sound of a warhorn in the distance, cutting through the stillness of the night. The horn echoed across the hills, a chilling reminder that they were not yet free. Each time it sounded, it seemed to grow louder, closer—a constant warning that the search party was out there, hunting them.  
<br>

The captives kept moving, constantly hearing that warhorn in the distance, a haunting reminder that they were still being pursued. They could never let their guard down. The sound of it never quite faded, always lingering in the back of their minds, fueling their need to stay one step ahead. There was no rest, no safety—not until they put more miles between themselves and the danger behind.  
<br>

On the third day, as hunger began to gnaw at their stomachs, they stumbled upon a small cluster of farmhouses. The fields were empty, the owners working far out in the distance. For a moment, they hesitated. The rogue—ever the pragmatic one—suggested they loot the houses for food and supplies. But others wondered if they should take it a step further—burn the houses to the ground, leave nothing behind to trace them.  
<br>

After a tense discussion, they opted to loot the homes, taking only what they needed and leaving the structures untouched. They had no interest in senseless destruction, but there was something undeniably bitter about the choice—how far had they fallen? They had been slaves, but were they now becoming thieves?  
<br>

As they made their way from the farmhouses, they saw something on the horizon—the port of Haven Gate. A bustling port, full of ships coming and going. It was the first sign of civilization they had seen in days, and the hope that it offered seemed like a lifeline.  
<br>
When they arrived at the port, it seemed like a world apart from the wild, untamed lands they had been fleeing through. The noise of merchants haggling, the calls of sailors preparing their ships for departure, the smell of salt and fish in the air—it all seemed so alien to them now, so far removed from their former life.  
<br>

It was there, in the bustling docks, that a mailman approached them—a seemingly ordinary figure, not particularly remarkable in appearance, but striking in the way he seemed to have found them. The fact that he was able to track them down amidst the chaos of the city seemed impossible. Yet, there he was, standing before them, a letter in his hand. No introduction, no explanation—just a sealed parchment with a mark they had never seen before.  
<br>

The letter was from Lady Marissa, a warlord of Vardak. It was short and to the point: she had heard of their escape and wanted to know if they were interested in helping her with a task, in exchange for her assistance in their struggle. There were no promises, no grand offers—just an invitation to consider the offer.  
<br>

As they read the letter, they faced a choice. Return deeper into Vardak, into the heart of the conflict that had bound them as slaves, or take their chances elsewhere, perhaps even on the high seas. The letter hung between them like a distant star, offering a glimpse of something more than survival—but they would have to choose whether to trust Lady Marissa and take her offer.
