Today, we've revisited and reimagined the continents, integrating the newly established themes and tone of the campaign. These updates aim to enrich the world with a cohesive narrative and a deeper sense of mystery and intrigue. The continents now reflect the balance between the world's beauty and the darkness lurking beneath, aligning with the overarching themes of the campaign. Additionally, some sections were updated to reflect new ideas and mechanics.

Changes Made:
- Revised all six continents (Shengdao, Sylvaris, Glaciaris, Saharun, Vardak, Eldarheim) to better align with the new themes and tone.
- Created new short descriptions for the continents to appear on the home page.
- Updated the worldâ€™s magic section to reflect the "magic-policing special forces" concept inspired by cyberpsychosis.
- Renamed the "The World" section to a more fitting title: Lore.
- Added a mysterious element to the oceans, with ancient, enigmatic islands dotting the waters between continents.
- Finalized the structure for the entry description and world summary on the home page.
