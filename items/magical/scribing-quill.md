## Quill of Scribing
*Wondrous item,* <strong style="color: lightblue"><em>uncommon</em></strong>

This elegant, feathered quill hums with quiet magical energy. The tip never dulls, and it produces a fine black ink without ever needing to be refilled.

### **The quill has two primary magical properties**:

* **Endless Writing**: <br>
When used normally, the quill writes with perfect clarity and never runs out of ink. It does not require an ink pot for mundane writing. The quill is favored by scholars, scribes, and archivists for its reliability.

* **Voice Transcription**: <br>
As an action, a creature can speak the quill’s command word and place it upright on any solid surface with parchment beneath it. For up to 1 hour, the quill automatically transcribes all clearly spoken words within a 30-foot radius, writing them neatly onto the parchment. The quill records all audible conversations unless instructed (by a second command word) to focus only on a single speaker within range.
The quill does not distinguish between truth and lies, emotion, or speaker intent. Whispered, muffled, or magical speech may not be captured accurately at the DM's discretion.

* **Spell Scribing**: <br>
When used to copy spells into a spellbook or onto a spell scroll, the Quill of Scribing halves the time required to complete the transcription. However, creating magical inscriptions still requires special magical inks and materials as normal. The quill’s endless ink is insufficient for maintaining spellcraft.

### **Notes**:

* If the quill is broken, its magic is lost.

* Some rare versions of the quill exist that can translate languages automatically (very rare versions).
