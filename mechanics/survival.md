# Survival in Drakharis
Survival is more than just tracking rations—it’s a challenge, a risk, and sometimes an opportunity. Managing food, water, rest, and the dangers of travel is crucial, but resourcefulness matters just as much as resources.

## Food & Foraging
Finding Food
Food isn’t always guaranteed. Players can:

* Forage: Search for berries, roots, or edible plants.
* Hunt: Track and kill animals (or monsters) for meat.
* Trade or Steal: Acquire supplies through diplomacy or force.  

### Quality Matters
Not all food is equal:

Food Type	Effect
* Raw Meat	Stops hunger but may cause sickness.
* Cooked Meat	No risk, restores some health.
* Seasoned Dish	Grants minor buffs (+1 to CON saves for a day).
* Rare/Exotic Meal	Special effects, unknown until consumed.
Some foods may have hidden effects, both good and bad.

## Water & Hydration
Finding & Purifying Water
* Freshwater sources: Rivers, wells, rain collection.
* Purification: Boiling, magical cleansing, or special items.
* Contaminated Water: May cause sickness, exhaustion, or worse.
Going without water for too long leads to exhaustion and hallucinations.

## Rest & Camping
Campfire Moments
Setting up camp isn’t just a long rest—it’s a chance for:

* Storytelling & strategy discussions.
* Nighttime events: Strange noises, visitors, or hidden dangers.
* Watch shifts: Keeping the fire lit may deter some threats—but attract others.
Sleeping in the wild is risky. Choose where you rest carefully.

## Starvation
Instead of instantly dying from hunger, players suffer gradual penalties:
  
| Days Without Food | Effect |
| ------ | ------ |
| 1 Day | No effect. |
| 2 Days | Level 1 Exhaustion. |
| 3 Days |	Level 2 Exhaustion, hallucinations. |
| 4+ Days | Increasing exhaustion, madness checks, risk of death. |

## Travel & Fatigue
How Travel Works
* Fast Travel (Forced March): Covers more ground but causes exhaustion if overused.
* Normal Travel: No penalties, but encounters may happen.
* Slow Travel (Stealth or Cautious Travel): Reduces risk but takes longer.

Certain environments make travel harder:

| Terrain Type	|Effect|
| ------ | ------ |
| Plains & Roads	|Normal movement speed.|
| Forests & Hills	|Half speed unless using a trail.|
| Mountains & Snow	|Exhaustion risk, half speed, and survival checks.|
| Swamps & Deserts	|Extra water loss, risk of sinking, exhaustion risk.|
  
Travel Fatigue
After 8+ hours of travel, players must roll CON saves to avoid exhaustion.
Traveling without proper gear (clothes, shoes, or mounts) makes rolls harder.  

## Weather & Exposure
Weather in Drakharis is unpredictable and dangerous.

Extreme Heat & Cold
  
|Condition	|Effect|
|----|----|
|Scorching Heat|	Requires extra water, CON save or gain exhaustion.|
|Freezing Cold|	Requires warm gear, CON save or take 1d4 cold damage per hour.|
|Heavy Rain| Disadvantage on perception checks, muddy terrain slows movement.|
|Sandstorms| Vision reduced, survival checks to avoid getting lost.|
|Blizzards| Extreme cold + risk of being buried in snow.|
|Fog & Mist| Reduces visibility, perception checks harder, navigation difficult.|
  
Players must prepare for the weather or face deadly consequences.

## Unique & Magical Survival Elements
Survival isn’t just about food, it’s about what you find.

* Cursed fruit that feeds you but causes nightmares.
* Ancient wells that grant visions… or madness.
* Meat from eldritch creatures—will it sustain you or change you?
Some survival choices have consequences beyond hunger.

## Player Creativity & Solutions
Players can overcome survival challenges in different ways:

* Magic: Druids can summon food, but is it enough?
* Alchemy: Purify water or enhance food.
* Resourcefulness: Can you make deals or steal what you need?
Survival in Drakharis isn’t just about eating—it’s about how you survive.

## Exhaustion

### Overcoming Exhaustion through Actions:
#### Encouragement and Team Support:  
The party can work together to help someone in need. Players could help alleviate exhaustion through roleplaying by taking on additional responsibilities (like keeping watch or preparing meals). This doesn't eliminate exhaustion entirely but helps maintain the group's strength by allowing more efficient teamwork.  
#### Items and Comforts:
Luxury items like blankets, warm drinks, or comforting items (perhaps a blanket from home or something personal to the character) could slightly reduce exhaustion when the player rests or recovers from long periods of stress or difficult travels.
  
### Exhaustion Removal
* Short Rest: Does not remove exhaustion. While short rests can help with other resources (Hit Dice, spells, etc.), they cannot alleviate exhaustion. Players will need to plan their recovery more carefully.

* Long Rest: Removes certain amount of exhaustion based on ceraint [conditions]({{"/mechanics/survival#factors-that-affect-exhaustion-recovery" | absolute_url}}). This is the primary way to remove exhaustion. A full 8 hours of uninterrupted rest is required for this recovery, where the character sleeps, eats, and takes care of basic needs.

* Relaxing Activities: Special activities or rest can help reduce exhaustion, but these are rare and conditional. They might include:

    * Spending a day in a peaceful environment (such as a healing temple, a village retreat, or a safe haven).
    * Bathing in a hot spring or relaxing by a natural feature (e.g., a serene lake).
    * Spending time in a safe and calm area, like a friendly town where there are few threats and a comfortable environment.
    * Special magic items or potions that promote relaxation and recovery could also be used.
    * Spending time with allies in a comforting and supportive way, such as playing a game, singing together, or telling stories around a campfire.

### Consequences of Not Managing Exhaustion
Exhaustion, when left unchecked, can lead to severe consequences:

* Level 1 Exhaustion: Disadvantage on Ability Checks.
* Level 2 Exhaustion: Speed is reduced by 10ft.
* Level 3 Exhaustion: Disadvantage on Attack Rolls and Saving Throws.
* Level 4 Exhaustion: Hit Point maximum is halved.
* Level 5 Exhaustion: Speed is reduced to 0.
* Level 6 Exhaustion: The character dies.
  
As exhaustion increases, the penalties become increasingly crippling, making it imperative to rest properly. If players are not careful, exhaustion could even lead to death.

### Factors That Affect Exhaustion Recovery:

* Environment Quality:

    * Safe and peaceful place (e.g., a village inn, a protected shelter, a monastery): Removes 1-2 levels of exhaustion. The more comfortable and undisturbed the environment, the better the rest.
    * Wilderness, while protected (e.g., a forest glade, a cozy cave): Removes 1 level of exhaustion, but there’s still a risk of environmental threats, making it less restorative.
    * Dangerous or uncomfortable environments (e.g., a stormy night, haunted woods, or a battlefield): Removes 0-1 levels of exhaustion. Rest here is disrupted by environmental factors, reducing the quality of recovery.
    * Hostile environments (e.g., a dungeon, a plague-ridden town, or a place filled with supernatural threats): Removes 0 levels. Exhaustion can worsen in these environments due to fear, danger, or discomfort.

* Food and Water:

    * High-quality food and water (e.g., fresh meals, nourishing herbs, clean water): +1 level of exhaustion removed. This helps the character regain strength and vitality more quickly.
    * Basic sustenance (e.g., rations, scavenged food, or average meals): No bonus, but still sufficient to allow for exhaustion recovery.
    * Lack of food or poor nutrition (e.g., stale bread, minimal rations, or no food): -1 level of exhaustion removed, or no recovery at all. Inadequate nutrition makes recovery more difficult.

* Weather and Climate (if not sheltered):

    * Perfect weather (e.g., clear skies, mild temperatures, no storms): +1 level removed, making it easier to sleep and recuperate.
    * Uncomfortable but tolerable weather (e.g., mild rain, cold but manageable temperatures): No bonus, but sufficient for a basic rest.
    * Extreme or harsh weather (e.g., blizzards, heatwaves, torrential rain): -1 level of exhaustion removed. The harsh conditions impede quality rest, making it difficult to recover.

* Mental State:

    * Stress-free rest (e.g., in a peaceful environment, with supportive companions, or after a satisfying accomplishment): +1 level of exhaustion removed. Relaxation and peace of mind help the body and mind recover.
    * Moderate mental strain (e.g., worrying about an upcoming fight, dealing with some personal issues): No bonus, but a decent rest can still occur.
    * Highly stressed or anxious state (e.g., constant fear, nightmares, unresolved trauma): -1 level of exhaustion removed. Stress and anxiety disrupt the body’s recovery, preventing proper rest.

* Magical Assistance:

    * Healing magic or magical healing items (e.g., spells like Greater Restoration, Lesser Restoration, or magic items that aid in healing): +1-2 levels removed. Some magic can help alleviate the physical and mental toll of exhaustion.
    * Basic healing magic (e.g., Cure Wounds or potions that heal hit points): +1 level removed. Some restorative magic still aids recovery.
