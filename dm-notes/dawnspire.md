* The Inquisition: A high-ranking Inquisitor might hire the players to track down a supposed heretic or investigate a suspected rogue magic user.

* Lost Artifact of the Flame: The players could be tasked with retrieving a powerful artifact tied to the Flame, perhaps in a forgotten temple, ancient ruin, or the depths of a sacred library.

* Rebel Alliance: The underground group known as the Shadow of the Flame might recruit the players to sabotage Church operations, spread dissent, or liberate the oppressed.
