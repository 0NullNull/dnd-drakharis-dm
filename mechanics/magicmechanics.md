# Magic System Overview
The magic system in Drakharis builds upon the foundations of D&D 5E while introducing new elements that enhance player creativity and flexibility in spellcasting. The system is designed to be easy to understand, with a layer of complexity for those who wish to explore its depths. It consists of three main components: Leyline Attunement, Spellcrafting, and Glyph-Based Magic.

## Leyline Attunement
Attuning to a leyline means fully embodying a specific element or school of magic, granting spellcasters extraordinary abilities and power. This deep connection allows them to cast spells exclusively from that school, significantly enhancing their effectiveness.

### Benefits of Attunement
When a spellcaster attunes to a leyline, they gain the following powerful advantages:

#### Exclusive Spellcasting: 
While attuned to a leyline, spellcasters can only cast spells from the chosen element or school. This limitation is offset by the massive benefits they receive.

#### Enhanced Spell Effects:

- Increased Damage: Spells that align with the attuned leyline deal significantly more damage (e.g., +2d6 damage).
- Extended Range: The range of spells cast from the attuned leyline is increased (e.g., an additional 60 feet).
- Additional Effects: Spells may gain unique properties based on their element or school (e.g., ice spells may slow targets, illusion spells may create sensory distortions).
- Spell Slot Efficiency: Spellcasters can cast spells of the attuned element or school using one level lower than normal (e.g., a spell normally requiring a 4th-level slot can be cast using a 3rd-level slot).

### Unique Signature Move: 
As they progress, spellcasters can unlock a powerful unique ability that embodies their attunement, such as:

- Elemental Cataclysm: Unleash a devastating attack that combines all their attuned spells into one massive effect (e.g., summoning a storm of fire, ice, or lightning).
- School Mastery: Gain advantages that represent mastery of a particular school (e.g., illusionists can create convincing illusions that affect multiple senses).
- Resistance: Spellcasters gain resistance to damage from their attuned element or school, reinforcing their connection and survivability.

### Restrictions of Attunement
While attuning offers substantial benefits, it comes with restrictions:

- Limited Spellcasting:  
Spellcasters can only cast spells from the attuned element or school. This requires careful planning and specialization, focusing their characterâ€™s development on mastering that specific area.

- Commitment to the Element:  
Characters must fully embrace their attunement, leading to significant roleplay opportunities and character development centered around that element or school.

### Attunement Process: 
Attuning to a leyline involves significant effort:
Requires a time investment, such as a long rest at a leyline nexus and performing specific rituals.

## Spellcrafting
Spellcrafting enables spellcasters to create unique spells by modifying or combining existing spells from the 5E spell list. This allows for greater customization and creativity in spellcasting.

### Creating New Spells
Spellcasters can modify a base spell in various ways, potentially combining elements from multiple spells to create a new spell on their character's spell list.
Drawbacks:  
Powerful crafted spells come with specific drawbacks, which can include:
- Conditions to be Met: Certain circumstances must be fulfilled for the spell to work.
- Material or Life Requirements: Some spells may require specific components or sacrifices to cast.
- Complexity Costs: If a caster tries to make a lower-level spell too complex, it may require using a higher-level spell slot.

## Glyph-based Magic
Glyph-based magic provides an alternative method of spellcasting for half-caster classes. This system emphasizes the creation of magical circles (glyphs) to facilitate spellcasting.

### Magical Circles:
Spellcasters can draw a magical circle for a spell during their turn, preparing it for activation. Each circle remains until activated or expires after a few turns.
The target or location must be defined when creating the circle, ensuring that spells are cast on the intended target at that time.

### Modifier Glyphs:
Unique enhancements can be drawn within the main spell circle, including:
Amplify Glyph: Increases damage or extends range.
Delay Glyph: Allows the spell to be activated later, even outside the caster's turn.
Linked Glyph: Connects two spells, triggering their effects simultaneously or chaining them together.
These glyphs have their own requirements and limitations to maintain balance.
### Limitations:
The defined target when creating circles cannot be changed after the spell is set.
