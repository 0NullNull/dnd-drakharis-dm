# World of Drakharis  
In the world of Drakharis, every continent, archipelago, and island is steeped in ancient magic, untold history, and a balance between light and shadow. This intricate tapestry of landscapes, cultures, and conflicts is woven together by the very essence of the world itself, which pulses with power and possibility.  

At the heart of this world lies [Sylvaris](world/sylvaris), the largest landmass, a place where nature thrives in all its diversity. Here, towering forests blanket the land, rich with ancient magic that hums through the air. From the serene meadows to the treacherous swamps, life flows abundantly, nurturing and protecting the secrets hidden beneath the lush canopy. The towering mountains pierce the sky like jagged teeth, casting long shadows over the verdant lands below, while magical groves deep within Sylvaris pulse with arcane energy, untouched for centuries. This is the land where all journeys often begin, but rarely end.  
  
To the north lies the stark and desolate [Glaciaris](world/glaciaris), where winter’s icy grip never relents. It is a land of eternal war, where two mighty kingdoms have clashed for centuries over land and honor. Here, amidst the frozen plains and towering glaciers, armies clash beneath the auroras, their breath freezing in the frigid air. The sounds of swords meeting shields echo across the barren expanse, and the people who dwell here have known no peace for generations. Battle-hardened warriors march across the tundra, their resolve as unyielding as the ice beneath their feet.  

To the south, the blistering sun beats down upon [Saharun](world/saharun), a vast desert of endless dunes and scorched earth. But beneath the surface, it hides untold wonders—lost cities buried by time, forgotten temples dedicated to gods long forsaken, and oases where life clings to the harsh land. Those who traverse the shifting sands know that the desert is as unforgiving as it is beautiful. Nomadic tribes, guided by the stars and the whispers of ancient spirits, make their home here, wandering from oasis to oasis. Yet, even in its barrenness, [Saharun](world/saharun) is not without intrigue, as travelers often seek its forgotten relics and the hidden knowledge held within the desert's bones.  

In the west, Vardak seethes with unrest. A continent torn by strife, warlords vie for power in a constant game of dominance and survival. It is a land rich in resources but cursed by endless conflict. Its landscape is rugged, with jagged cliffs, dark forests, and plains that stretch endlessly under a grim sky. The ground here is soaked with blood and sweat, and the cries of battle are ever-present. Mercenaries from across the world come to Vardak, drawn to the promise of gold, glory, or a swift death. Chaos rules here, as the strong thrive and the weak perish, and alliances shift like the wind.  

In the east, [Shengdao](world/shengdao) stands in serene contrast. A land of tranquil valleys, towering mountains that touch the clouds, and rivers that wind through peaceful villages, [Shengdao](world/shengdao) is a place of deep spiritual reflection and quiet wisdom. Monasteries dot the landscape, and the monks who live within their walls dedicate themselves to balance and enlightenment. The people here live in harmony with nature, seeking to understand the deeper mysteries of the world, while distant temples guard ancient knowledge. But even in its peace, there is power, as those who have mastered the ways of the mind and body can summon forces that few in Drakharis can comprehend.  

To the northeast lies [Eldarheim](world/eldarheim), the smallest of the continents, yet perhaps the most insular. Ruled by a single kingdom of pureblooded elves and humans, it is a land of sharp lines and even sharper divisions. The people of [Eldarheim](world/eldarheim) pride themselves on their untainted lineage, and they view all other races with disdain, enforcing strict societal hierarchies to maintain their dominance. The cities here are grand, their architecture a testament to the kingdom’s ancient lineage, but beneath the beauty lies a simmering tension, as those who do not fit the kingdom’s strict ideals live in the shadows, oppressed and marginalized.  

Between the continents, the seas are dotted with numerous islands and archipelagos, each with its own story. The Misty Isles are shrouded in an eternal fog, where sailors tell tales of ghosts and lost ships. The Coral Reefs of Saris boast radiant, glowing underwater cities built by a mysterious aquatic race. The Shattered Archipelago is a dangerous region of jagged islands, where pirates and outcasts find refuge amidst treacherous waters. The Isle of Whispers is a place of dark magic, where the wind carries eerie, hushed voices that drive those who linger too long to madness. And then there is the Emerald Atoll, a serene paradise where ancient druids guard secrets older than the world itself.  

In essence, the world of Drakharis is a living entity, rich with stories waiting to be told. Its landscapes, peoples, and mysteries are interconnected, creating a dynamic and ever-changing environment where every choice can tip the scales of fate. In this world, the balance between light and dark, order and chaos, is a delicate dance that shapes the destiny of all who call it home.
