# Part 2:<br> The Deal with Lady Marissa  
<br>

After much deliberation, the group decided to trust Lady Marissa, at least for the time being. They made their way to her war camp, Vultures Perch, where she wasted no time giving them their first task: damage the rival warlord Korath, the very man whose grasp they had just escaped. Lady Marissa’s terms were simple—hurt Korath or his land in some way, and in return, she would help them leave Vardak.  
<br>

The Bard, ever boastful, couldn't resist the chance to share his self-proclaimed glorious past. He told Marissa, with great pride, that he had once been a respected ship captain. What he neglected to mention was that his actual role had been that of a lowly coxswain. In his usual confident manner, he boldly requested a ship of their own in exchange for the task. Lady Marissa, ever pragmatic, agreed, though she warned that it would take a few days to procure a vessel.  
<br>

With the deal struck, the group set their sights on Korath, initially considering a direct assault on his stronghold. But, after a moment of reflection, the thought of going up against a warlord and his army on their own turf seemed less than wise. Instead, they decided to target one of the villages Korath had taken over—burn it down, disrupt his control, and make a statement.  
<br>

The plan was to sneak close to the village walls and toss fire bombs inside to start a blaze. Two members of the group— a Loxodon and a Weresnake— took on the dangerous task. However, things didn't go as smoothly as they hoped. The Loxodon, having indulged in quite a bit of alcohol before the attempt, clumsily stumbled towards the wall, yelling at it in a drunken haze. Miraculously, he managed to throw the firebomb over the wall, though it was by pure luck. Meanwhile, the Weresnake, ever the stealthy one, easily slipped up to the wall and tossed his firebomb with precision.  
<br>

The Loxodon, emboldened by his success, started running away, drunkenly cursing and laughing. A guard spotted them and began to fire arrows, but luck was on their side as none of the arrows hit their mark. As they sprinted toward the woods, the Loxodon, still holding the dwarf artificer, stumbled along, nearly tripping over branches. The dwarf, looking for something to take his mind off the chaotic escape, tried to spot orphanages to burn down but settled on shooting random firebolts over the walls for fun.  
<br>

They didn’t get to witness the full extent of the fire’s destruction, since they didn't have time to look back. The mission was a success, and all they needed to do now was escape.  
<br>

Upon returning to Vultures Perch, they could see the smoke and fire rising in the distance—proof of their work. Lady Marissa, impressed with the results, kept her word. She promised a ship within a few days. True to her word, a small vessel, not much more than a modest boat, awaited them. It wasn't the mighty ship they had envisioned, but it was enough to carry them away from Vardak.  
<br>

As a final gesture, Lady Marissa handed them her magical insignia—an item that allowed them to send messages to her. She explained that its power was limited but could prove useful when shown in the right places.  
<br>

For the first time in a long while, the group felt free. They stood at the edge of Vardak, the sea stretching before them, ready to set sail on their new journey.
