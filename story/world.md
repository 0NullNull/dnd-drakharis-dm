# The World
## Magic in the World
In this world, magic is a rare and mysterious force, known to most but practiced by few. While anyone has the potential to wield it, the consequences of doing so are severe, making it a dangerous art that few dare to master. For most, the temptation of magic is overshadowed by its high costs, and the risk of unleashing destructive power or invoking terrible consequences keeps the masses from exploring its depths.    
Magic is viewed with a sense of reverence and fear—something that can offer immense power, but only at great personal sacrifice. Some practitioners focus on subtle and dangerous spells, weaving small yet potent magics that can change the course of events in hidden ways. Others pursue devastating forces capable of reshaping reality itself, but such power comes with dire consequences, both for the caster and the world around them.  
The use of magic is forbidden in many places, with ancient laws and cultural taboos preventing its casual use. Yet despite this, there are those who risk everything, seeking forbidden knowledge and the promise of unmatched power, or simply using magic as a means of survival. These magics remain shrouded in mystery, with only the bravest or most desperate daring to tread where others would fear to follow.

## The Eldritch Influence
The eldritch forces in the world are subtle and hidden, rarely manifesting in direct ways but always lurking in the shadows of reality. They are ancient and unknowable, existing on the fringes of mortal understanding. These forces do not shape the world entirely but have left their mark in pockets of corruption and distortion, their influence seeping into the fabric of society and the natural world. Some areas, once peaceful and harmonious, now bear the lingering scars of their hidden meddling, though few know the true cause.
  
While most of the world remains blissfully unaware of these eldritch powers, there are a select few who are keenly aware of their presence. These individuals often keep this knowledge to themselves, believing it to be best that the common folk remain ignorant of the horrors that lie just beyond perception. The rare few who have had direct contact with these entities speak of an otherworldly horror beyond comprehension, a presence that defies the natural laws and twists reality to its will.
  
The signs of their influence are often faint—a subtle unease in the air, strange dreams, the appearance of unnatural phenomena, or unsettling occurrences that don't fit the natural order. These signs are enough for the learned or paranoid to recognize, but most dismiss them as mere coincidence or superstition. Still, there are whispers of ancient, forbidden texts and forgotten rituals that could awaken or summon these eldritch forces, should anyone dare to meddle too deeply.
  
In some parts of the world, there are dark cults or secret societies that venerate these eldritch beings, believing that their power offers an escape from the suffering of the world or a way to transcend mortal limitations. However, these groups are few and their practices are hidden, as their influence is not something that the wider world would tolerate. For the most part, the eldritch forces remain distant, waiting for the right moment to reveal their true, terrifying nature.

## Day-to-Day Life
In the heart of the great cities, life is relatively prosperous. The people in these urban centers enjoy a comfortable existence, shielded by the towering walls, advanced technology, and protective magic. The cities, despite the lurking darkness, feel like havens of safety. The common folk here live with a sense of optimism, blissfully unaware of the true horrors that simmer beneath the surface. Their lives are influenced by the bustling trade, the power of the government, and the reputation of adventurers and guilds who handle the more dangerous elements of the world. The wealthy maintain a stronghold of influence, while the poor struggle, though many find solace in their communal support systems. The rich and powerful are often removed from the common populace's daily struggles, with divides in wealth and status creating tensions that occasionally spill into the streets.
  
In stark contrast, life beyond the walls of the cities is far more grim. The further one travels from urban centers, the more desperate and hopeless the situation becomes. In rural areas, people scrape by on meager resources, facing threats from both nature and the encroaching darkness that seeps in from the edges of civilization. Without the protective barriers of wealth or power, survival becomes a daily battle. People in these areas live in fear, constantly aware of the world’s darker side and less shielded from its horrors. Without the strong hand of government or guilds, it is the influence of the Church that holds sway here, guiding people with their teachings, offering both comfort and control in a harsh world.
  
Magic, in the hands of the common folk, is largely feared and avoided. Most view it as a dangerous and corrupting force. However, underground criminal organizations—particularly those involving doctors—use forbidden magic to provide medical treatment for those in desperate need. These shadowy figures are seen by some as a necessary evil, offering hope where none exists. But to the average person, magic remains something to avoid, a disease that can turn even the most well-meaning into something unrecognizable.
  
The Eldritch horrors that silently influence the world remain hidden to most. The common people have no knowledge of their existence, and any whispers of such things are quickly silenced. A select few, however, are aware of the creeping presence of these forces, and they work hard to keep this knowledge hidden from the masses, believing that keeping the horrors a secret is the best way to preserve the fragile peace.
