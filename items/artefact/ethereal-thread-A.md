## Awakened Ethereal Thread
*Artifact item,* <strong style="color: purple"><em>Awakened</em></strong>  
This ethereal, shimmering thread appears nearly invisible to the naked eye, its true form only revealed under magical scrutiny. Once attuned, the thread pulses with an otherworldly power, connecting the user to a creature of their choosing across great distances. When the connection is made, your consciousness manifests in the Ethereal Plane, allowing you to perceive and interact with the world in a heightened way.

### **Properties**:

* **Attaching the Thread**: <br>
As an action, you must touch a creature within 5 feet to attach the Ethereal Thread to it. Once attached, the thread becomes ethereal and can pass through walls, ceilings, and other obstacles, stretching seemingly indefinitely.

* **Manifest Your Consciousness**: <br>
Once the thread is attached, you can manifest your consciousness in the Ethereal Plane, tethered to the creature. However, before this can happen, you must maintain concentration for 1 hour without interruption. Only after the hour of uninterrupted concentration will you manifest in the Ethereal Plane near the creature. This manifestation allows you to move freely within a 100-foot radius of the creature, though you cannot precieve anything further than 100 feet away from the creature and remain tethered to it. Your presence is ethereal, allowing you to pass through physical objects but unable to interact with them physically.

* **Eternal Duration**: <br>
Once attached, the thread remains indefinitely without requiring reactivation. You can stay in the Ethereal Plane near the creature for as long as you wish, though the longer you stay the more insane you might become.

* **Severing the Thread**: <br>
The thread can be severed by either the creature (if aware of the thread) or the user. Severing the thread requires a bonus action. Once severed, the effect ends immediately, and you are no longer incapacitated.

* **Ethereal Visibility**: <br>
The thread is almost invisible to the naked eye, but it can be seen through magical means such as true sight or detect magic. Additionally, in the Ethereal Plane, the thread glows brightly and can be easily traced to its origin, revealing the userâ€™s location and their connection to the creature.
