# Fenn the Wild
**Role:** Druid of Chaos
## Description 
A whimsical gnome druid with a connection to the unpredictable forces of nature, Fenn embodies the chaos inherent in the wild. His attire is made of mismatched animal furs, and he often communicates with creatures in strange, fragmented sentences.
## Background
Fenn wandered away from his peaceful grove, believing that nature needs chaos to thrive. He uses his abilities to instigate wildfires or floods as a means of rejuvenation, seeing himself as a catalyst for necessary change.
