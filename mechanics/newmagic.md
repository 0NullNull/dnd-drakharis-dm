# The Nature of Magic
Magic in Drakharis is a rare and enigmatic force, woven into the very fabric of the world. Its presence is often overlooked, its influence faint but undeniable. In some places, whispers of its power linger in the air, forgotten by most but still accessible to those who know where to look. For those who seek it, magic can be a useful tool, one that offers new paths and possibilities.  

Yet, as with all things, the nature of magic is not always straightforward. Its use is often a matter of choice, and its results can be... unpredictable. Few truly understand the deeper currents beneath its surface. Some claim that the more it is called upon, the more one begins to sense its presence, in ways that are not always easy to explain.  

It is said that those who study the arcane too intently may find themselves facing strange coincidences, fleeting visions, or unsettling feelings when they least expect it. Whether these occurrences are the result of magicâ€™s subtle influence, or something else entirely, remains a subject of quiet speculation. But it is a truth that some prefer not to question too deeply.  

For those who do, the answers may not always be what they expect.

# Unlawful Sorcery
In Drakharis, magic is not something that is freely embraced. While its potential is known to a few, its use is heavily restricted across most of the world. In many places, the casting of spells is viewed with suspicion, and those who practice magic are often seen as a threat to the established order.

Laws in most regions are clear: magic is reserved for only the most trusted, and even then, its use is tightly controlled. Those who are caught wielding power without sanction face serious consequences. In some cities, the mere hint of magic can be enough to stir unrest, as the line between acceptable use and dangerous influence is thin and easily crossed.

Despite this, there are whispers of places where the use of magic is tolerated, or even secretly encouraged. Yet such places are rare, and the knowledge of where they exist is not shared lightly.

For most, the prudent path is to avoid drawing attention. After all, the world has seen the consequences of magic used without restraint, and many are content to let it remain a shadow, hidden in the corners of history.
