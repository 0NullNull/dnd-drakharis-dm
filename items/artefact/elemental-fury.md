# Ring of Elemental Fury
## *Artefact* 
**Rarity:** Very Rare
## Description
This ancient ring grants the wearer mastery over the elements. Once per day, the wearer can cast the spell Elemental Bane on up to four creatures, choosing one of each elemental damage type to affect each creature. The ring also grants resistance to one of the four elements (fire, cold, lightning, or acid) and can be changed after a long rest.
## Drawback 
The ring draws energy directly from the Elemental Planes. For each day the ring is worn, there is a 10% chance the wearer attracts the attention of an elemental lord, who may seek to reclaim the power of the ring. Such encounters could result in devastating consequences for the wearer and those around them.
