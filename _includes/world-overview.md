# World of Drakharis  
Welcome to a world of breathtaking beauty, where towering cities, magical forests, and floating islands stand as monuments to ancient powers. Yet beneath this stunning landscape, a hidden darkness brews—forces long forgotten, lingering in the shadows. Magic, once a common and revered force, is now forbidden across much of the world. Its use is seen as a dangerous practice, one that brings disaster and calamity. The true cost of wielding such power remains a well-guarded secret, known only to a few, but it is feared that those who dare to use magic risk awakening something far darker than they can imagine. In this land, survival is fragile, and the secrets of the past may hold the key to an uncertain future. Will you uncover the truth, or will the forces you seek to control consume you?
  
[Sylvaris](world/sylvaris), the heart of the world, is a land of contrasts. Vast magical forests, sprawling plains, and snow-capped mountains shape its beauty. Though the most populous continent, much remains untamed wilderness. Nature thrives beside human settlements, creating a balance of enchantment and civilization. While not without danger, [Sylvaris](world/sylvaris) is among the safest lands—though still more perilous than the tranquil [Shengdao](world/shengdao).
  
Nestled in the far north, [Glaciaris](world/glaciaris) is a frozen wasteland marked by an endless war between two nations, dividing the continent into battlegrounds. The landscape is harsh and unforgiving, where magic is a tool of war and survival is a daily struggle. Amidst the cold and conflict, corruption seeps into both the land and its people, and those who dare venture here must be prepared for the relentless forces of nature and mankind alike.
  
To the south, [Saharun](world/saharun) is a barren desert where only a few cities survive, clinging to life amid endless dunes. In the remnants of ancient civilizations, magic is both a tool and a secret. This land is dangerous, with bandits, pirates lurking. Amidst the desolation, one coastal city stands as a mystery of prosperity.

To the west, [Vardak](world/vardak) is a land steeped in blood and conquest. The earth itself bears the scars of countless battles, its fields littered with the remnants of fallen warriors. Mercenaries and warlords rule with iron fists, their allegiances shifting as quickly as the tides of war. Here, strength is the only law, and those who cannot fight are little more than prey. Magic is a weapon of war—wielded without mercy, twisted to serve the ambitions of those desperate for power. Corruption seeps into every city and stronghold, festering beneath the banners of generals and kings alike. In [Vardak](world/vardak), peace is but a fleeting dream, and the clash of steel is the only constant.

[Shengdao](world/shengdao) is a land of beauty and peace, where towering peaks and lush valleys seem to hold the world at bay. Protected by an ancient magic that has kept it safe for generations, the monks of Shengdao guard this land with dedication and wisdom. To the people, [Shengdao](world/shengdao) is a place of harmony—its tranquility unmarred by the struggles of the outside world.

[Eldarheim](world/eldarheim), the smallest continent, is also the most insular. Ruled by a kingdom of pureblooded elves and humans, it enforces strict hierarchies and shuns other races. Its grand cities reflect an ancient lineage, but beneath the beauty lies deep division. Those who don’t fit the kingdom’s ideals live in the shadows, oppressed and marginalized. Pride in untainted blood fuels both its strength and its simmering tensions.

The vast oceans separating the continents are dotted with ancient, mysterious islands, remnants of forgotten civilizations and strange, unexplained phenomena. These islands, often shrouded in mist, hold secrets long lost to time, with some whispering of eldritch horrors and others harboring untold riches. Their enigmatic nature calls to adventurers and explorers, promising discovery but also danger lurking in the unknown.

The choices are yours to make. Will you venture into the desolate wastelands, where lost cities lie in ruin, or seek the hidden truths locked away within the floating islands? Will you challenge the authorities who enforce the ban on magic, or uncover the forgotten knowledge that lies beyond their reach? Amidst the chaos of war, the rise of mercenaries, and the whispers of gods, what path will you walk?  

As your story unfolds, the choices you make will shape the world around you. Will you uncover the hidden truths that bind this world together, or will the very forces you seek to control turn against you? The land is full of possibilities, each corner hiding both wonders and dangers, waiting for those bold enough to seek them out. But tread carefully, for the path you choose may lead you into realms beyond your understanding, and not all who venture down these roads return unchanged.

Will you risk it all to learn what lies beneath the surface, or *destroy* the world trying?
