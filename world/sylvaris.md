# Sylvaris
The continent of Sylvaris is a vast, vibrant land of ancient magic, lush forests, and shifting political power. Though it appears serene and enchanting, Sylvaris hides tensions just beneath the surface—between kingdoms, within secret orders, and among the old druidic traditions that once ruled unopposed. The continent is divided into several major regions, each ruled or influenced by unique cultures and powers. Below is a summary of each kingdom and faction, with links to their dedicated pages:

## [Divine Empire of Dawnspire]({{"world/dawnspire" | absolute_url}})

A rigid theocracy ruled by a radiant Empress and governed through divine law and dogma. The Empire claims spiritual superiority over all others, branding outsiders, heretics, and non-humans as impure or lesser. Magic not sanctioned by the Church is heresy, and dissent is met with quiet disappearances or public penance. Cities gleam with white stone and gold, but beneath the beauty lies a zealous grip on power. Faith is law, and questioning it is dangerous.

## Kingdom of Lorienna

The Kingdom of Lorienna is a realm of contrasts, where diverse landscapes meet and blend seamlessly. Known for its trade, exploration, and political intrigue, Lorienna is a land of noble houses, bustling cities, and vast wilderness. Magic is viewed with cautious respect here—valued for its practical applications in commerce and defense. Lorienna’s people thrive on ambition and personal freedom. The kingdom’s borders stretch across swamps, forests, and grasslands, with a wealth of resources both magical and mundane waiting to be uncovered.

## Sylvan Accord Confederation

The Sylvan Accord Confederation stands in stark contrast to the rigid control of the Divine Empire of Dawnspire. In this mystical land, magic flows freely and is woven into the very fabric of life. Ancient city-states, protected by powerful arcane wards, thrive on the study and mastery of magic, both natural and otherworldly. Here, magic is not only revered but is essential to survival and prosperity. The dense jungles and swampy marshlands hide powerful relics, forgotten shrines, and untapped sources of magic, making the Confederation a place of both intrigue and danger for those seeking forbidden knowledge.

## Druidic Clan of Thronspire

An insular druidic clan that has resisted the advance of civilization for centuries. Guardians of ancient groves and forgotten rites, they keep to themselves but hold secret knowledge of the land. Travelers are watched closely, and outsiders rarely leave unchanged.
