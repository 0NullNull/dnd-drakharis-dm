# Emerald Pearl
## *Artefact* 
## Description
A beautifully iridescent pearl that radiates a soothing green light, calling to the depths of natureâ€™s waters.
## Effect
- The bearer can cast the **Control Water spell** at will without expending a spell slot. The controlled water is imbued with **healing** properties for the *next hour*, restoring **2d4 hit points** to any creature that drinks or bathes in it, after which the healing property dissipates. 
- Once per long rest, the bearer can summon a tidal wave (as per the **Tsunami spell**) to wash over an area, dealing **6d10 bludgeoning** damage to creatures in its path (**DC 18** Strength saving throw for half damage). 

## Condition
- The bearer **must** use ***natural*** water sources (like rivers, lakes, or oceans) when casting spells; the source **must** be pure and flowing.

## Catastrophic Consequence
- If ***natural*** water is not *specified* or if used in a **dry environment**, a flood will occur that rushes toward the pearl, dealing **3d10 bludgeoning** damage to the *bearer and nearby creatures*. Additionally, if used in a polluted water source, the healing effects are **negated**, and the area is flooded with **toxic water**, forcing creatures to make a **DC 15** Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for *1 hour*.

## Curse
- The bearer becomes increasingly drawn to bodies of water, often feeling an uncontrollable urge to seek out and immerse themselves in water sources. If they go more than **24 hours** without contact with a natural flowing water, they suffer disadvantage on all ability checks and saving throws until they do.
