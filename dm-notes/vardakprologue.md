# Escape routes
## Secret Pirate Smuggling Routes
* Description: A well-hidden network of smugglers who regularly transport goods and people out of Vardak under the radar of the authorities. These routes are largely unknown, but rumors circulate that pirates or rogue traders occasionally offer their services to those desperate enough to pay the price.
* Challenge: Players must track down the right contacts and either negotiate or trade their way into gaining access. There’s a risk of betrayal, and they’ll need to avoid detection by both the military and rival criminals. They could also be forced to help these smugglers with a dangerous mission in exchange for transport.
* Possible Locations: The port or one of the more remote towns, such as Forgotten Grove, could house individuals with knowledge of these routes.

## The In-Between
* Description: The dreamlike realm of the In-Between, which offers fast travel across vast distances. If the players can stumble upon an entry point (an anomaly in reality, like a strange tear in space or a distortion in the landscape), they may use it to escape Vardak, potentially emerging on another continent.
* Challenge: This realm is dangerous, full of unpredictable hazards and nightmares. The players would have to find a way to navigate the In-Between and avoid being consumed by the horrors within. The key challenge lies in finding the right entry point, and perhaps even finding a way to manipulate the realm to their advantage.
* Possible Locations: A chance encounter with an Interloper, a rare entity that has mastered the In-Between, might offer guidance. Entry points are unpredictable, though some may manifest in places of strange energy or deep shadow.

The In-Between is a place of strange, shifting space. The air is thick, like it’s made of broken dreams, and the sky is a chaotic blend of colors that don’t quite belong. As the players fumble in this disorienting space, they catch a glimpse of a figure—flickering, out of place. It seems to shift in and out of existence like it's both here and not.

The Interloper appears in front of them, with a slow, smooth motion that distorts the air around it. It doesn’t seem like it’s walking; its form just glides, and the space around it ripples.

The Interloper doesn’t speak immediately. It watches the players for a moment, eyes glowing, like it’s evaluating them.

The Interloper (after a long pause):
"Foolish. But... interesting."

There’s no hostility in its tone—just an apathetic curiosity, like it’s seen things like this before and doesn’t really care. It lifts its hand and waves it casually. The In-Between shifts, creating a flicker of light—a rift in the chaotic space that almost resembles a doorway.

The Interloper (nonchalantly):
"You’re lost."

The rift stays open, swirling gently as the Interloper observes the players. There’s a strange feeling in the air, like the In-Between itself is waiting for something.

The Interloper (in a flat tone, as if offering something obvious):
"You can leave... through here."

It doesn’t step forward, doesn’t make any attempt to move the players. It’s simply offering them the way out—almost as if it’s indifferent whether they take it or not.

The Interloper (slightly more distant, like it's losing interest):
"But it won’t be easy. Time is... tricky. You’ll be fine, I think."

The figure doesn't seem to care about their choice—just a detached observation. As if it's made its decision already, it turns slightly, its form beginning to flicker again. The rift grows more unstable, pulsing with energy.

The Interloper (final, quiet observation):
"Perhaps you will learn something... or not."

And just like that, the rift remains open. The Interloper steps back, leaving the players with a single choice.

Post-Encounter Impact:

The Interloper shows its power by manipulating the In-Between effortlessly, creating a rift to lead the players out without hesitation.
There’s no emotional attachment to the players, no real care about whether they live or die—just an apathetic curiosity about their presence.
Time in the In-Between is still unpredictable, and the players will feel the lingering effects, but the Interloper gives them a way out, leaving them to deal with the consequences on their own.
No more explanation from the Interloper—its presence is more unsettling because of the lack of care or concern.


## Airships and the High Seas
* Description: While most ships from Vardak stay near the coastline, there are rumors of airships that travel long distances, bypassing the dangers of the sea. Airship captains may be able to take the players away from the island, but only if they can negotiate a safe passage and find a ship willing to take them.
* Challenge: These airships are rare, and not all are trustworthy. Some may be controlled by pirate factions, while others might be part of larger guilds or mercenary groups. There are also storms to contend with, and any ship making a long journey has to deal with the possibility of mechanical failure or attacks from rival forces.
* Possible Locations: The Port of Sunder is likely a hub for ship and airship activity. The players could seek out captains with dubious reputations or request passage from wealthy travelers who might have connections to airship crews.

## Hidden Underground Tunnels
* Description: Ancient ruins beneath Vardak may hold secrets of tunnels or caves that lead out of the continent. These tunnels are part of the long-forgotten paths used by old civilizations, now buried and lost to most. Some factions might know of them, and with the right keys (ancient maps, hidden artifacts, or alliances), players could access these subterranean routes.
* Challenge: These tunnels could be booby-trapped, full of monstrous creatures, or guarded by old magic. The players would need to find the right clues and tools to open the path. There's also the risk of becoming trapped underground or finding their exit blocked.
* Possible Locations: The ruins in remote parts of Vardak or the outskirts of larger cities may house entrance points. Certain factions may have pieces of the puzzle, making it a race against time to get the information before others do.

## Magic and Portals
* Description: The land of Vardak is seeped in dark magic, and ancient mages or hidden sects might possess the knowledge of teleportation rituals or other arcane means to leave the continent. These spells or magical devices are likely lost or forbidden, and finding them would involve unraveling mysteries from deep within ancient libraries or finding artifacts.
* Challenge: Learning to use magic to escape may require the players to find a mentor, an ancient tome, or a long-forgotten artifact. This would involve navigating both magical and political danger, as the more powerful factions may not want these rituals to fall into the wrong hands.
* Possible Locations: Forbidden temples, arcane libraries, or isolated ruins might hide these ancient rituals. They may also find hidden pieces of this magic through encounters with powerful sorcerers or lost scholars who are willing to exchange knowledge for a price.

## Allying with the Right Factions
* Description: Several factions may have the ability to help the players escape, either through military transport, hidden resources, or secret alliances. If the players can gain the trust of a powerful faction or group (pirates, traders, rebel groups, or mercenaries), they might be able to negotiate safe passage off the continent.
* Challenge: Each faction has its own agenda, and gaining their trust could require completing tasks, making dangerous deals, or offering something of great value in return. Some factions may even want the players to do something morally questionable before offering their help.
* Possible Locations: These factions may be hidden in the shadows of the larger cities, operating in secret. The players would need to gather information and possibly find out which groups can be trusted.
