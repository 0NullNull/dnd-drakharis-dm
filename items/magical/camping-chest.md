## Camping Chest
*Wondrous item,* <strong style="color: green"><em>rare</em></strong>

This large, intricately carved chest is etched with ancient runes of stability and comfort. Upon activation, it transforms into a small, fully furnished house, providing a warm and comfortable shelter for travelers. The house includes everything needed for a comfortable stay, such as a cozy hearth, a well-stocked kitchen, and magical insulation to maintain an ideal temperature regardless of the weather outside.

### **Activation & Duration**:

* To activate the Camping Chest, the user must concentrate for 1 hour. During this time, the user must remain stationary and focused on the chest.

* After the hour of concentration, the chest transforms into a house that lasts for a minimum of 24 hours. Once the 24-hour period has passed, the house remains unpacked indefinitely until the user decides to pack it up.

* Packing the house requires 10 minutes of concentration, during which the house gradually returns to its chest form. Once packed, the chest cannot be unpacked again until the next day at noon.

* **Inside During Packing**: <br>
If the house is packed while creatures are inside, they are ejected from the house and placed in the nearest unoccupied space outside the house (likely outside the chest or in the immediate vicinity).

### **House Features**:

* **Room for Eight**: <br>
The house can comfortably accommodate up to eight Medium creatures. It includes a main room, a kitchen, sleeping areas, and a bathroom (if desired).

* **Comfortable Furnishings**: <br>
The house comes furnished with beds, chairs, a fireplace for warmth, and a magically self-cleaning stove for cooking. It also includes simple tables and chairs.

* **Magical Insulation**: <br>
The house keeps a comfortable temperature at all times, regardless of external weather conditions.

* **Security Features**: <br>
The house has a magical lock (only the chestâ€™s owner can open it) and a magical alarm system that alerts the user if someone tries to break in or tamper with the house.

### **Limitations**:
* Once the house is unpacked, it cannot be moved, magically or otherwise, from its location. The house is permanently anchored to the spot where it was unpacked. Attempts to move, teleport, or physically shift the house (via magic such as Telekinesis or Levitate, or by mundane means) fail.

* **Magical Lock & Alarm**: <br>
The magical lock and alarm will resist most mundane tampering but may be bypassed by powerful magic like Knock or Dispel Magic.
