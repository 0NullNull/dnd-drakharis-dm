# The World
## Magic in the World
In this world, magic is considered too dangerous and volatile for common use, and its unauthorized practice is met with swift and brutal retribution. Those caught casting magic illegally are hunted down by specialized enforcers known as the Wardens. These trained agents, often cloaked in dark armor infused with magic resistance, are tasked with tracking down rogue practitioners and ensuring that the fragile peace of society remains intact. Wardens possess both advanced combat skills and magical abilities, allowing them to neutralize offenders with a mix of deadly force and powerful anti-magic techniques.

The presence of the Wardens has led to a deep-seated fear of magic in the general populace. Most people view it not only as dangerous but as something that can quickly turn against them. Even whispers of magic in the wrong places can result in swift action by the authorities, leaving no room for leniency. Public trials are rare, as magic users are typically taken before they can be apprehended, often disappearing into unknown prisons or worse.

While some regions have their own laws regarding magic, the Wardens are a universal force, operating across the continents. Their goal is not only to eradicate magic abuse but to ensure that the very existence of these forbidden arts remains hidden from the masses, protecting the world from the consequences of unchecked magical power.

## The Eldritch Influence
The eldritch forces in the world are subtle and hidden, rarely manifesting in direct ways but always lurking in the shadows of reality. They are ancient and unknowable, existing on the fringes of mortal understanding. These forces do not shape the world entirely but have left their mark in pockets of corruption and distortion, their influence seeping into the fabric of society and the natural world. Some areas, once peaceful and harmonious, now bear the lingering scars of their hidden meddling, though few know the true cause.
  
While most of the world remains blissfully unaware of these eldritch powers, there are a select few who are keenly aware of their presence. These individuals often keep this knowledge to themselves, believing it to be best that the common folk remain ignorant of the horrors that lie just beyond perception. The rare few who have had direct contact with these entities speak of an otherworldly horror beyond comprehension, a presence that defies the natural laws and twists reality to its will.
  
The signs of their influence are often faint—a subtle unease in the air, strange dreams, the appearance of unnatural phenomena, or unsettling occurrences that don't fit the natural order. These signs are enough for the learned or paranoid to recognize, but most dismiss them as mere coincidence or superstition. Still, there are whispers of ancient, forbidden texts and forgotten rituals that could awaken or summon these eldritch forces, should anyone dare to meddle too deeply.
  
In some parts of the world, there are dark cults or secret societies that venerate these eldritch beings, believing that their power offers an escape from the suffering of the world or a way to transcend mortal limitations. However, these groups are few and their practices are hidden, as their influence is not something that the wider world would tolerate. For the most part, the eldritch forces remain distant, waiting for the right moment to reveal their true, terrifying nature.

## Day-to-Day Life
In the heart of the great cities, life is relatively prosperous. The people in these urban centers enjoy a comfortable existence, shielded by the towering walls, advanced technology, and protective magic. The cities, despite the lurking darkness, feel like havens of safety. The common folk here live with a sense of optimism, blissfully unaware of the true horrors that simmer beneath the surface. Their lives are influenced by the bustling trade, the power of the government, and the reputation of adventurers and guilds who handle the more dangerous elements of the world. The wealthy maintain a stronghold of influence, while the poor struggle, though many find solace in their communal support systems. The rich and powerful are often removed from the common populace's daily struggles, with divides in wealth and status creating tensions that occasionally spill into the streets.
  
In stark contrast, life beyond the walls of the cities is far more grim. The further one travels from urban centers, the more desperate and hopeless the situation becomes. In rural areas, people scrape by on meager resources, facing threats from both nature and the encroaching darkness that seeps in from the edges of civilization. Without the protective barriers of wealth or power, survival becomes a daily battle. People in these areas live in fear, constantly aware of the world’s darker side and less shielded from its horrors. Without the strong hand of government or guilds, it is the influence of the Church that holds sway here, guiding people with their teachings, offering both comfort and control in a harsh world.
  
Magic, in the hands of the common folk, is largely feared and avoided. Most view it as a dangerous and corrupting force. However, underground criminal organizations—particularly those involving doctors—use forbidden magic to provide medical treatment for those in desperate need. These shadowy figures are seen by some as a necessary evil, offering hope where none exists. But to the average person, magic remains something to avoid, a disease that can turn even the most well-meaning into something unrecognizable.
  
The Eldritch horrors that silently influence the world remain hidden to most. The common people have no knowledge of their existence, and any whispers of such things are quickly silenced. A select few, however, are aware of the creeping presence of these forces, and they work hard to keep this knowledge hidden from the masses, believing that keeping the horrors a secret is the best way to preserve the fragile peace.
