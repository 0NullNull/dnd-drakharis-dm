# Shackles of Vardak

You don’t remember the last time you saw the sun properly, not since you were captured. Time has become a blur. Days and nights blend together in the clanking of chains, the crack of whips, and the taste of dust in your mouth. Vardak, a continent of unrelenting heat and cruelty, has claimed you as one of its many broken souls.
  
Your life before captivity seems like another lifetime—faded memories of freedom, of lands untouched by the horrors of Vardak. The land of endless deserts and oppressive heat, where slavers rule with iron fists and the few who are free survive by the strength of their wits and steel.
<br>
<br>

The slavers, those who captured you, are the worst of the worst. They roam the barren wastes and take what they want: people, land, anything of value. You and your companions were just another prize to be carted off, sold to the highest bidder. But you are not weak. You endured, you resisted, and now you find yourself on the cusp of freedom.
  
  <br>
<br>
In the dead of night, you broke free. The slaver camp was a cage, but you were determined to escape. The path ahead is filled with danger. Vardak’s wilds are not forgiving, and neither are the men and women who make their living hunting down escapees. Even now, the hot breath of pursuit is close, and you know that you must act quickly.
<br>
<br>
  
But there's a problem: **where to go**?
  
<br>
Vardak is a continent of deserts, wilderness, and constant struggle. To escape its clutches, you will need more than luck. You will need a plan. You’ve heard rumors of the coast—of the towns where smugglers, pirates, and mercenaries make their living. But these same rumors speak of the dangers that await you there. And even if you do find the coast, the slavers have eyes everywhere. The roads are filled with their scouts. Your only option might be to get off the continent entirely, to find a way to a distant land where you can be free.
  
Yet... there’s something unsettling in the air. The coastal towns are well-known to those who wish to escape, but is that really your only hope? Could there be another way off this forsaken land—something hidden, a forgotten path in some secret corner of Vardak? It’s hard to say for certain. But if you have any hope of finding it, you’ll need to think beyond the obvious.
<br>
<br>

In the dead of night, you found yourself and your companions in a place you don’t recognize. The terrain is strange, unfamiliar—a rocky stretch of desert, littered with the remnants of ruined structures. The faint scent of the sea lingers in the air, but you can’t tell which direction to go. You're lost, disoriented, and for the first time in weeks, free. But that freedom is fragile. It could be snatched away if you aren’t careful.
  
You have no map, no clear direction, and the unknown stretches out before you. You can only guess what lies ahead, but the danger feels ever-present. Your pursuers won’t stop until they find you, and if you stay in one place too long, <strong style="color: red">they'll catch up</strong>. The only hope you have seems to be the coastal towns, where escape may be possible. But... is that all? Could there be something else out there, something hidden in the desert or far from the shore that could offer you a way out?
<br>
<br>

For now, the answers are elusive. The more you think about it, the more questions arise. Why does the coast seem like the only option? What secrets lie in the wilderness? And why, in a land so vast, do you have the nagging feeling that you’re missing something? Perhaps this place holds more than just slavers and criminals.

<br>
<br> 
This is the beginning of your journey. You must gather your bearings, find out where you are, and figure out what to do next. The sun beats down on you as you struggle to regain your sense of purpose. Your options are unclear, and there’s no guarantee you’ll even make it to the nearest town.  
But there’s one thing you know for sure: <strong style="color: red">you can’t stay here</strong>.
