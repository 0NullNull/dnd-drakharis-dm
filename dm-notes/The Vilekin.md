# 🐀 The Vilekin
A cunning, mutated race of ratlike humanoids that infest the sewers, ruins, and forgotten tunnels beneath civilization.

## ✴️ Overview
The Vilekin are a scattered yet deeply connected network of ratfolk who thrive in the shadows. Seen by surface dwellers as myth, plague, or urban legend, the Vilekin are in truth a hidden empire of black market syndicates, saboteurs, alchemists, and information brokers who manipulate cities from below.

No one truly knows how old their civilization is—some say they predate the cities above, others that they were once cursed or created by a long-forgotten mage god of secrets.

## ⚫️ Culture & Structure
### 🧩 Society
Vilekin society is structured into Clans, each ruled by a Whisperlord or Brood Matron.

A Council of Teeth composed of the most powerful clan leaders meets only in times of great upheaval (or opportunity).

The average Vilekin lives and dies by the Black Doctrine: “What is taken is earned. What is hidden is power.”

### 🐾 Caste Roles:
* Whispers: Espionage experts and messengers, trained from birth to memorize secrets and deliver coded messages.

* Stitchers: Alchemists, plague-brewers, and flesh-shapers who work with toxins and mutations.

* Fangs: Elite assassins and enforcers who use stealth, poison, and guerrilla tactics.

* Scratcheyes: Tinkerers, scrappers, and magitech scavengers. They make weapons from junk, and junk from corpses.

## 🕳️ The Underbelly Network
* The Vilekin live in an ever-shifting system of:

* Tunnel-warrens under cities, with trap-filled corridors and illusion-hidden doorways.

* Rotmarkets, sprawling black markets filled with stolen relics, cursed items, forbidden magic, and living contraband.

* The Deepchant, a whispering system of communication using echoes, tapping, and coded speech that resonates through pipes and walls.

* They control most of the illegal trade in major cities and act as middlemen between rival factions, thieves' guilds, and darker entities.

"*If you want to vanish a noble, sell a soul, or find a forgotten god’s tooth… you go to the Vilekin.*"
