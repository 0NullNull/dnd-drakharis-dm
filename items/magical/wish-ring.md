## Ring of Simple Wishes
*Wondrous item,* ***very rare*** (consumed upon use)

This delicate silver band hums faintly with untapped magic. It is said to carry the echoes of an ancient, forgotten wish.

While wearing this ring, a creature may speak a single wish aloud. The wish must be simple, specific, and reasonable, a request that does not bend or break the fundamental laws of reality.
After the wish is spoken, the ring vanishes, consumed by the magic within it.

The effect of the wish is subtle and not always immediate.

* If the wish is straightforward and easily measurable ("I wish for a loaf of bread"), it may happen quickly.

* If the wish relates to ongoing events ("I wish for safe passage through the forest"), its success or failure may only be discovered over time.

* If the wish is vague or large in scale ("I wish for a chest full of gold"), the magic will not conjure the desired object outright. Instead, it may influence future events in a way that aligns with the spirit of the wish. For example, after making such a wish, the next chest the wielder finds might be filled with gold.

The wearer has no immediate confirmation whether the wish has been granted. The fulfillment — if granted — will manifest in a way the ring's ancient magic deems appropriate.

### **Limitations**:

* The ring cannot grant complex, abstract, or world-altering wishes (such as "I wish to rule a kingdom" or "I wish for immortality").

* Overly complex or impossible wishes cause the ring to vanish without effect.
