# Sylvaris
Sylvaris is a land of great contrasts, a place where civilization flourishes amidst the wild beauty of nature. Its vast and varied geography includes magical forests, rolling plains, dense swamps, towering mountains, and cold northern tundras. Despite being the most populous continent, much of it remains untamed, a wilderness where the natural world reigns. The people of Sylvaris have built cities and settlements that coexist with the land, but the further one ventures into the wild, the less controlled the land becomes.
  
Magic is a known force in Sylvaris, but it is not something wielded by the common folk. While most know of its existence, magic is seen as a rare and powerful tool, with its use reserved for adventurers, scholars, and a select few. Some areas of Sylvaris view magic as forbidden or dangerous, while others embrace its power. The use of magic is not something to be taken lightly, as it carries great consequences, both in terms of cost and risk.
  
The continent is home to the Adventurers Guild, the largest and most powerful guild in the world. The Guild has its headquarters in Sylvaris, where it recruits and trains adventurers from all over. However, despite the Guild's influence, the rural regions of Sylvaris are much more isolated, where mistrust of outsiders is common, and tensions often run high.
  
While the beauty of Sylvaris is apparent, there is a subtle darkness that lies beneath the surface. It is not the kind of darkness that is immediately obvious, but rather a more insidious presence that shapes the land and its people. Some may feel its influence more than others, and while the people of Sylvaris live relatively safe lives, there are forces at work that they may not fully understand.
