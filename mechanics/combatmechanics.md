# Combat Mechanics
In this campaign, combat is not just about dice rolls and damage; it’s an arena for creativity and strategy. The rules are designed to empower players, allowing for innovative actions that can turn the tide of battle.

## Martial class love
All martial classes now have the Fighter: Battle Master Maneuvers and superiority dice, as per the battle master subclass.

## Player Freedom and Creativity
Players are encouraged to think outside the box. If you can come up with a creative solution or action that fits the narrative, the rules may bend to accommodate it. This fosters a dynamic combat experience where ingenuity can shine.
<div class="example-container">
<h3>Examples</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Explosive Escape: <br>
The wizard surrounded by enemies prepares to cast Fireball. Instead of just aiming the spell at the enemies, they strategically place a makeshift shield under their feet—perhaps a sturdy piece of armor or a conjured barrier. Aiming the fireball at their feet as the fireball detonates, they use the blast's force to propel themselves backward, launching away from danger. They declare that the shield absorbs the brunt of the explosion, allowing them to take no damage while using the spell’s energy to execute a dramatic escape.
</li>
<li>
Groundshaking Leap: <br>
The monk decides to leap off a high ledge and lands near a group of enemies, claiming their landing creates a tremor that causes the ground to shake. They suggest that all enemies within a radius must make a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone, allowing the monk to capitalize on the chaos with a flurry of attacks.
</li>
<li>
Cleave Attack: <br>
The barbarian is surrounded by multiple enemies. Instead of attacking just one, the player asks to make a cleave attack, swinging their weapon in a wide arc to hit two enemies who are close together. Allowing a single attack roll against both targets, showcasing the barbarian's strength and combat style.
</li>
<li>
Chain of Fury: <br>
The fighter seizes an opportunity to grapple an enemy, using their brute strength to control the situation. Instead of merely holding the enemy in place, they declare that they will throw the grappled foe toward an adjacent ally. Upon successfully throwing the enemy, the ally has the chance to make an immediate attack against the thrown target without using their action. This creative maneuver not only disrupts the enemy’s position but also provides an extra attack opportunity, turning the grapple into a dynamic and cooperative combat tactic.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

## Combo System
The combat system incorporates a Combo System, allowing players to chain actions together in a single turn. If a player proposes a creative plan that involves multiple actions, they can execute those actions in one turn, as long as they can narratively justify it. This could include combining a ranged attack with a tactical maneuver or using the environment in clever ways.

### For example, a player might want to:

- Throw a potion to create a barrier of smoke, then use their movement to hide within it before firing an arrow at an unsuspecting enemy.
- Use a combination of acrobatics and melee attacks to flip off a wall, disarm an opponent, and land in a defensive position.

## 2 Player Combo System
In Drakharis, players have the opportunity to unleash powerful combo attacks by working together seamlessly. When two players are adjacent to each other on the battlefield, they can choose to combine their turns into a single, coordinated action. This system encourages teamwork and creative tactics, allowing for more dynamic and engaging combat encounters.

### Mechanics:

- Simultaneous Actions:  
Both players declare their actions at the same time and execute them together, combining their efforts for maximum effect. They may use any available actions, bonuses, or reactions during this combined turn.
- Single Target or Multiple Targets:  
The combo attack must target the same enemy or a specific set of enemies within range, emphasizing coordination and strategy.
- Creative Freedom:  
Players are encouraged to think outside the box and propose unique combinations of actions, with the rules bending to accommodate inventive ideas that enhance gameplay.

<div class="example-container">
<h3>Examples</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Elemental Assault:<br>
A sorcerer uses Fire Bolt while a rogue throws a vial of oil at the same target. The sorcerer’s spell ignites the oil, dealing additional damage as the rogue’s attack creates a fiery explosion.
</li>
<li>
Pincer Movement:<br>
A fighter charges toward an enemy, while a bard casts Dissonant Whispers to distract them. As the fighter engages the enemy, the bard’s spell causes the target to flee, directly into the fighter's path, allowing for an opportunity attack that triggers an additional attack.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

## Unique Reactions

Reactions are not restricted to normal 5E rules. Players can use their reactions in unique ways, such as:

- Redirecting an attack by using the environment (e.g., kicking a barrel towards the enemy to disrupt the attack).
- Bracing a nearby ally that would be pushed back or knocked prone, negating the push.
- or anything, as long as it is creative and justifiable as a "Reaction".

The focus is on adaptability and teamwork, encouraging players to communicate and strategize during combat.

# Overwhelming Fight System
In the Overwhelming Fight System, battles become dramatically intensified based on the balance of power between the opposing sides. This system emphasizes the feeling of dominance, allowing the overwhelming side to unleash devastating attacks while minimizing the impact of the weaker side's actions.

## Activation Conditions
The Overwhelming Fight is activated when one side demonstrates a significant advantage in combat, such as overwhelming numbers, superior tactics, or extraordinary power. This can occur in various ways, such as:

- Overpowering the Opponent: If the players or enemies exhibit overwhelming strength, whether through level, abilities, or sheer numbers, an Overwhelming Fight may commence.
- Mid-Battle Requests: Players can request the DM to initiate an Overwhelming Fight if they believe they have established clear superiority. If the DM agrees, the battle may shift mid-combat to reflect this dynamic.  

## Benefits of the Overwhelming Side
When one side qualifies for the Overwhelming Fight, they gain significant advantages, which can include:

- Decisive Strikes: Successful attacks against **significantly** weaker opponents result in outright kills without needing to roll for damage, representing the sheer power of the overwhelming side.

- Diminished Resistance: Weaker opponents may struggle to land successful attacks, with their strikes often being deflected or ignored.

### Unique Actions: 
The overwhelming side may access unique combat maneuvers that showcase their dominance. These actions could defy standard combat rules, such as:

- Brutal Finish:  
An overwhelming attack that automatically takes down a foe without having to roll for damage.
- Frightening Presence:  
A skill that causes weaker foes to hesitate, granting disadvantage on their next attack rolls.
- Unyielding Defense:  
A passive ability that allows the overwhelming side to ignore a certain number of successful hits, reflecting their superior resilience.

## Perceptive Cues for Players:
If the enemies have the upper hand, players may notice changes in the enemies’ behavior, such as becoming cocky or taunting. This could signal that the enemies are activating the overwhelming bonuses, hinting that it might be wise to retreat before the foes fully harness the advantages of the Overwhelming Fight. The DM can drop subtle clues—like a villain’s laughter or dismissive gestures—that indicate the tide has turned, prompting players to reconsider their strategy.

## Signature Moves
In the heat of battle, players have the opportunity to unleash their unique Signature Moves during Overwhelming Fights or if it feels fitting with the current fight. These powerful abilities are designed to showcase a character’s strengths and creativity, reflecting their growth and mastery in combat. Signature Moves are only accessible in these heightened circumstances, allowing players to dramatically alter the course of an encounter.

### Creating Signature Moves:
Players are encouraged to collaborate with the DM to create personalized Signature Moves that align with their character’s abilities and backstory. When designing these moves, consider the following guidelines:

- Powerful Impact:  
Signature Moves should be more potent than standard actions, delivering a significant impact on the battle. They can deal extra damage, inflict conditions, or provide unique advantages.
- Thematic Resonance:  
Signature Moves should reflect the character’s identity, abilities, and personal journey. Incorporating elements of their backstory or character traits can enhance the thematic resonance of the move.
Limited Usage:  
Signature Moves can only be used during Overwhelming Fights and Epic Fights, adding an element of strategy. Players must decide when to unleash their move for maximum effect.
- Creative Execution:  
Signature Moves involve dynamic storytelling elements, requiring players to narrate how they perform their action. This adds depth to the combat experience and enhances engagement.

### Approval Process:
Players should present their proposed Signature Moves to the DM for approval. The DM may suggest modifications to ensure balance and fit within the campaign's narrative. Once approved, these moves can be utilized during appropriate encounters.
