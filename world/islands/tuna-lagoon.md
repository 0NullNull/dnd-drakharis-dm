# Tuna Lagoon
The tide draws your vessel into the lagoon like a whispered secret. The water is still and heavy, its surface mirroring a sky half-swallowed by gray clouds. As you pass between sheer cliffs and into the vast bay, your eyes are immediately pulled toward the mountain range that rises like a god’s spine from the island’s heart—jagged, immense, and unnatural in its symmetry. The tallest peak bears veins of obsidian and a crown of ever-churning mist. Thunder occasionally murmurs behind it, though the sky above remains clear.  
<br>

Nestled in the dense jungle at the foot of that mountain is something alien to this place: the shattered wreck of a once-magnificent airship.  
<br>

Its hull, charred and overgrown with strangling vines, lies in several enormous sections scattered across the canopy. Enchanted metal plating is warped and twisted around massive trees. A shattered propulsion core is half-sunk in a ravine that glows faintly with unstable magical residue. The trees nearest it are withered to ash.  
<br>

Among the wreckage: containment pods, once magically sealed, now broken and burnt open. Deep claw marks, acid scoring, and the bones of crew members suggest a violent escape. However, one container—larger, reinforced, and sealed with failing runes—remains intact. Inside, frozen in a state of forced stasis, coils a Remorhaz, its body twitching slightly beneath layers of cracked frost and crystal mana seals.
