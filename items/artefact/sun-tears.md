# Tears of the Sun
## *Artefact* 
**Rarity:** Very Rare  
## Description
These radiant, sun-colored crystals contain the raw essence of the sun itself. When held, the crystals can cast **Sunbeam (6th-level spell)** *once per day*. The light emitted by the crystals is powerful enough to cut through magical darkness and obliterate weaker undead or shadow-based creatures. The crystals also grant the ***attuned*** creature resistance to fire damage while in possession.
## Drawback
The crystalsâ€™ energy is **volatile**. Each time the Sunbeam is cast, there is a **5%** chance the crystal will explode in a fiery burst, all creatures within a **30-foot** radius must make a Dexterity saving throw against a **DC of 18**. On a failed save, creatures take **12d10 fire damage** and are set on fire, taking an additional **1d10 fire damage** at the start of their turns. On a successful save, they take half damage and are not set on fire.
