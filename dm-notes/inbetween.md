## In-Between Navigation Table (Optional)
To provide structure for the travel mechanics, a random navigation table could be created to simulate the randomness of the realm. This could be used when the players are actively trying to navigate and determine where they end up.

|d6 roll|effect|
|1| The path seems stable, and you arrive at a familiar place. (Minimal time distortion)|
|2| You end up lost, traveling in circles. (Minor time distortion, possibly return to a previous location)|
|3| A sudden temporal distortion forces you to double back or lose hours of time. (Major time distortion)|
|4| The winds of the In-Between shift and carry you to a strange, unsettling place. (Arrival somewhere unexpected, minor madness)|
|5| You travel further than expected. Time is a blur. You might return to the material world to discover much more time has passed|
|6|	You encounter an Interloper or other enigmatic entity who guides you. Their presence may have an effect on your psyche.|

## Time Distortion Effects
In the In-Between, time works erratically. Each time a player exits, there is an effect on time between their journey through the realm and the world they return to. These effects should be rolled randomly or determined by the DM based on the time they’ve spent traveling:

|d6 roll|effect|
|1| **Temporal Confusion**: You’ve been gone for what feels like minutes, but days have passed in the material world.|
|2| **Past Events Return**: Something you thought was a memory, or an old wound, manifests during your journey.|
|3| **Wild Leap**: You arrive, but things have drastically changed. A friend is now an enemy, or someone has vanished completely.|
|4| **Synced Time**: Time flows as expected. You were only gone for a few minutes, and nothing in the world has shifted.|
|5| **Static Displacement**: Time’s flow is stagnant for you. Upon returning, you realize little or no time has passed at all.|
|6|	**Echoes of the In-Between**: Strange and unsettling memories from the In-Between linger. Reality is now intertwined with what you’ve seen.|
