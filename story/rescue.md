# Retards to the Rescue 
<br>

The story begins in Vardak, a continent wracked by conflict and suffering. The party, a group of escaped slaves from various parts of the continent, had recently made their way through the wilderness. After days of travel, they received a letter from Lady Marissa, a powerful figure in the region, offering them a deal. The specifics of the deal are not important for now, but as Lady Marissa’s offer came through, something strange occurred.  

In the middle of their discussions, the bard—one of the party’s key members—was suddenly sucked into the Veil. What seemed like only a few moments for the rest of the party turned into a year-long experience for the bard. The Veil, a realm of unstable realities, distorted time, and reality, warped his mind and perception. Though only a few days passed for the party, the bard was trapped for what felt like an eternity.  
<br>

When the bard finally emerged from the Veil, he was a changed man. Though the details of what happened to him in the realm remained a mystery, the experience left a permanent mark on his psyche. The uncontrollable urges to visit places and interact with objects that might connect him to the Veil became more frequent. His time in the Veil had not only altered his perception of time but had imprinted something dark upon him, something he could neither explain nor control.  

Meanwhile, Lady Marissa’s deal had already been concluded with the rest of the party. The ship was secured, and the group began their adventures, but the bard’s ordeal lingered as an unspoken weight.  
<br>

Fast forward to the present day: The party had made their way to Redwater Landing in Sylvaris. The bard, still struggling with his connection to the Veil, was walking through the market with the ranger, casually shopping. Suddenly, he felt that familiar and uncontrollable pull, an urge to enter a nearby alley. The ranger, confused but loyal, tried to follow, but before he could catch up, the bard vanished into thin air.  

Initially thinking it might be another warning from the assassins of the Gnarr’Kaan, the ranger quickly abandoned his pursuit of the bard and returned to the ship, intent on informing the rest of the crew. Upon hearing the news, the crew, though unsurprised by the bard’s strange disappearance, immediately began preparing to search for a new captain. Without missing a beat, they started writing up posters looking for a new captain, recognizing that it was time to move on.  
<br>

Once again in the Veil, the bard found himself in a dark, dimly lit room. There was a window, and through it, he saw a vision—a tiefling, chained in a magical cell, the site of a horrific experiment. The vision shifted as the tiefling’s patron possessed him, an unimaginable force that seemed to tear apart reality itself. The vision then cut away and returned to reveal a massive crater where the tiefling once was.  

Suddenly, the bard was thrust back into the material world. He found himself back in the alleyway, disoriented and unconscious, while only a few seconds had passed for the ranger. After several hours, the bard awoke in the alley, shaken by the vision he had witnessed. He stumbled back to the ship, his mind racing with terror and confusion, though he said nothing to anyone. He made his way downstairs, seeking solace in alcohol to dull the fear gnawing at him.  
<br>

Upon hearing the bard’s story and seeing the dread in his eyes, the party decided to venture to Vardak and investigate the strange vision. The bard’s unsettling connection to the Veil made it clear that the tiefling he had seen in the vision—and the crater—were linked to something far greater than they had anticipated.  

Upon arriving in Vardak, the bard once again felt the uncontrollable urge to move inland. As the party followed, they soon arrived at the very crater the bard had seen in his vision.  

As the party stood at the edge of the massive crater, the bard, still driven by forces beyond his control, walked toward its center. There, he thrust his Veil-touched spear into the ground. At that moment, a rift opened before him.  

But instead of being drawn into the rift, the bard regained his senses. Horrified by the rift’s presence and what it had made him do, he turned and began to flee, attempting to escape the rift. But before he could reach the others, a figure emerged from the rift: the Interloper, a mysterious being from beyond the material world.  

The Interloper didn’t speak, but it was clear that it had come for the bard. In an instant, it grabbed the bard and pulled him back into the rift, vanishing from sight.   
<br>

Inside the Veil, the bard was once again trapped in the realm of nightmares and shifting realities. The Interloper, cryptic and strange, appeared before him. It offered the bard a deal—what the deal was, the party never learned. But the bard, seemingly desperate and unable to resist, agreed.  

After the deal was struck, the Interloper vanished, leaving the bard to face whatever consequences lay ahead. He was once again thrust out of the Veil, back into the material world. The bard emerged from the rift in the crater, but he was no longer the same. His eyes were gouged out, and in their place, a set of ethereal eyes glowed unnaturally.  
<br>

Just as the party began to take in the bards’ terrifying transformation, the ground beneath them trembled. A Veil nightmare, a monstrous creature from the realm of the Veil, emerged from the rift. The party, already on edge, braced themselves for battle.  

After a fierce fight, the nightmare was finally defeated, and the rift in the crater remained open. The party, with no other way out, decided to follow the bard’s lead and entered the rift themselves, stepping into the Veil.  
<br>

Inside the Veil, the party discovered the tiefling from the bard’s vision—still chained in a dark, oppressive place. The bard, driven by his knowledge of the Veil, recognized the tiefling’s chains as part of the larger mystery they were all caught up in. But even more disturbing was the presence of the tiefling’s patron, an enormous, shadowy figure, chained in the distance as well.  

The bard, desperate to help, used his Veil-touched spear to help free the tiefling. The chains came loose, and the tiefling was freed from his imprisonment.  

But with the rift still open, the party quickly realized that there was no immediate way out. They were trapped in the Veil, with no clear path to return home.  

Once again, the bard turned to the Interloper for help. The Interloper, ever enigmatic, agreed to assist the party, and with its help, they were able to escape the Veil, stepping back into the material world just as the rift closed behind them.  
<br>

Exhausted, confused, and shaken, the party made their way to a nearby tavern to recover. The tiefling, now freed from his chains, was introduced to the rest of the party, and the group took time to process the events they had witnessed. As they gathered to discuss their next steps, the shadow of the Interloper’s deal still loomed over the bard, and the mysteries of the Veil—its nightmares, its Interlopers, and its ties to otherworldly patrons—remained unsolved.
