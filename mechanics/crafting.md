# Crafting System

## Overview

The crafting system in Drakharis is designed to encourage player creativity, allowing them to experiment and find unique solutions while gathering materials through exploration and foraging. The quality of materials and tools influences the outcome, but the most important factor is how the players approach crafting.

## Gathering Materials

Materials are categorized by rarity and have general properties rather than fixed uses. Players can gather these materials through foraging, hunting, mining, or salvaging.

### Material Categories:

* Metals & Alloys (Iron, Mythril, Voidsteel) – Used for weapons and armor.

* Herbs & Reagents (Bloodroot, Ashbloom) – Used for potions, poisons, and alchemy.

* Monster Parts (Wyvern Bone, Basilisk Eyes) – Used for enchantments, weapons and armor.

* Ancient Relics (Runestones, Arcane Crystals) – Used for powerful magical crafting.

### Rarity Tiers:

* Common – Found in most regions, basic uses.

* Uncommon – Requires effort to obtain, enhanced properties.

* Rare – Found in dangerous locations, holds strong magical properties.

* Legendary – Nearly impossible to acquire, used in crafting one-of-a-kind artifacts.

## Crafting Process

Crafting requires a Tool Kit and a Workstation (portable or found in towns). Players can either follow known recipes or experiment to discover new item combinations.

### Steps to Craft:

* Select Recipe or Experiment

    * If a player knows a recipe, they follow it.

    * If they experiment, they combine materials and describe their intended result. The DM determines the feasibility and outcome based on logic and material properties.

### Determine Crafting Time

* Basic Items: Minutes to an hour.

* Advanced Gear: Hours to days.

* Masterwork/Magical Items: Days to weeks.

### Success Based on Player Creativity

* Crafting results depend on how well the player describes the process and justifies their material choices.

* High-quality materials and specialized tools improve success chances.

* Failure results in wasted materials or unexpected effects, but creative problem-solving can mitigate this.
