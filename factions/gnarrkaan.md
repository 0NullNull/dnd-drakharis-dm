# Gnarr'Kaan <br> the Vilekin syndicate

The **Gnarr'Kaan** are a secretive and ruthless criminal syndicate that controls a large black market, its influence extending far beyond Redwater Landing. They deal in a wide range of illegal goods, including magic items, stolen relics, and contraband. While much about their operations remains hidden, it's clear they have a tight grip on the underground economy of the area.

What we do know is that the **Gnarr'Kaan** are led by Vilekin, a race known for their cunning and ruthlessness. They are manipulative and seem to operate from the shadows, using their natural abilities to stay hidden and control everything from behind the scenes. The true leadership structure remains a mystery to us, and it seems like their power extends far beyond what we can see.

The party's ranger, in a burst of irritation over the toll being charged to enter the sewer, "jokingly" told a random guard to investigate the matter. This casual remark ended up leading to the **Gnarr'Kaan** sending an assassin to make it abundantly clear that interfering with their operations—even in such a seemingly trivial way—was a serious mistake. The incident served as a loud, bloody reminder that the **Gnarr'Kaan** do not tolerate anyone meddling in their business.

One of the most notable features of the **Gnarr'Kaan**’s operations is their use of Gnaws, also known as "bites", as currency. These rare tokens are a sign of doing business with the syndicate and are used for transactions within their black market. While not handed out to just anyone, they are not impossible to procure, often traded among those who have established some form of connection with the syndicate. The value of Gnaws fluctuates depending on demand, and they are the exclusive currency accepted for dealings with the **Gnarr'Kaan**.
