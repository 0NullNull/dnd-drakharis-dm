    # Interloper

    * "*The air shifts when they step through it. Time falters, and shadows flicker with memory. What you see is never what it seems, and what you hear might be your own thoughts speaking back to you. They walk between worlds, bending what’s true until even your mind trembles at the thought of what is real.*"

    * Those who have crossed paths with an Interloper often find themselves haunted by fleeting memories of places that never were, or moments that never happened. What they want is unclear, their intentions veiled in the quiet spaces between time. Are they observing? Are they guiding? Or are they simply something else entirely, beyond even their own understanding?"

Interlopers are strange beings who seem to slip between the boundaries of reality. Their presence is unsettling, as though they don’t fully belong in the world. Those who’ve encountered them speak of time feeling off, memories becoming blurry, and a strange stillness in the air. Their powers remain a mystery, but some say they can manipulate the world in ways that defy explanation.

Though few know their true intentions, some players may have already crossed paths with an Interloper—perhaps in a fleeting moment or a strange event that doesn’t quite make sense. Be wary, for an encounter with one could leave its mark in ways that can’t always be explained.
