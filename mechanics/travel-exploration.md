# Camping Mechanics
Camping is an essential part of exploration and survival in the world of Drakharis. Properly setting up camp can significantly enhance the party's safety and rest during their travels. The following mechanics outline how to establish a quality camp and the effects of camping on gameplay.

## Setting Up Camp
When the party decides to camp for the night, each player rolls a d8 to determine the overall quality of the camp. The combined total of these rolls reflects how well the camp is established.

Rolling:  
Each player rolls a d8.  
Combining Totals:  
Add the results of all player rolls together.  
Modifiers:  
Players can apply bonuses based on the use of improvised defenses or favorable environmental conditions like:  
- Use natural materials to create barriers.
- Set traps or alarms.
- Use spells or abilities to enhance their camp setup.

## Quality Thresholds
To assess the quality of the camp, the total roll is compared against a threshold that scales with the number of players. The quality of the camp affects the likelihood of nighttime disturbances and the benefits gained during rest.

### Quality Threshold Formula:
<div class="formula">
(Number of players x 5) + 5
</div>

### Quality Outcomes:

- Low Total (1 - Threshold):  
The camp is poorly set up, resulting in a high chance of disturbances from creatures or environmental hazards.
- Moderate Total (Threshold + 1 to Threshold + 10):  
The camp is adequately established. Standard chance of nighttime encounters.
- High Total (Threshold + 11 or higher):  
The camp is well-established, granting additional benefits when resting and reducing the likelihood of disturbances.  
bonuses include:  
  - Temporary hit points upon waking.
  - Advantage on their next skill check or attack roll as they feel rested and prepared.

## Night Attacks
The likelihood of nighttime disturbances is adjusted based on the camp's quality. A low-quality camp faces a higher chance of encounters, while a high-quality camp benefits from reduced disturbance risks and additional bonuses when resting.
## Importance of Camping
Choosing when and where to set up camp is crucial. Players cannot simply rest whenever they want; they must consider their surroundings and the state of their camp. Good planning and teamwork during the setup process can greatly affect the party's safety and recovery.

# Travel and Exploration Mechanics
## Exhaustion System
Traveling long distances can take a toll on adventurers, which is why an exhaustion system has been introduced. Players can normally cover 24 miles in a day under ideal conditions without suffering any fatigue. However, for every additional 4 miles they travel beyond this limit, they will gain 1 level of exhaustion. This encourages players to think strategically about how far they push themselves, adding an element of risk to their journey.  
Players can choose how far they want to travel in a day, keeping in mind the following modifiers based on terrain and weather conditions:

### Terrain Challenges

- Normal Terrain:  
Players can travel 24 miles in a day without penalties.

- Difficult Terrain:  
If traveling through challenging terrain, such as dense forests or rugged mountains, the distance is reduced to 16 miles. Players must remain vigilant, as pushing beyond this limit will result in exhaustion.

- Hazardous Terrain:  
In particularly difficult environments like swamps, players can only cover 10 miles in a day. They must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw for every 2 additional miles to avoid gaining 1 level of exhaustion.

### Weather Effects
Weather conditions can significantly impact travel distance:

- Rain:  
Heavy rain reduces the travel distance to 20 miles. If players are unprepared, they must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to avoid slipping and gaining 1 level of exhaustion.

- Snow:  
Players can only travel 10 miles in snow-covered terrain. Characters must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw every 2 miles to prevent exhaustion from the cold, gaining 1 level of exhaustion upon failure.

- Storms:  
Severe storms limit travel to 5 miles for that day. Players must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to avoid 1 level of exhaustion due to exposure and fatigue.

- Heat:  
In extreme heat, if not prepared for high temperatures characters must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw for every 4 miles travelled. Failure results in gaining 1 level of exhaustion.

## Interactive Environments
The environments players traverse can be rich with opportunities for discovery. Characters might make perception checks to uncover hidden paths or shortcuts that could lead them to faster routes or secret locations. This interaction encourages players to remain engaged with their surroundings and rewards their curiosity.

## Resource Gathering
As adventurers explore, they have the chance to gather useful resources from their environment. By utilizing survival checks, players can identify and collect materials that may prove beneficial for crafting later on. This ties the exploration mechanics into the crafting system, making resource collection an integral part of their journeys.

## Exploration Events
To enhance the narrative and keep players on their toes, both random and scripted exploration events can be introduced. Players might find themselves ambushed by bandits or encounter wild creatures lurking nearby. They may also stumble upon ancient ruins filled with untold treasures or magical phenomena. Additionally, environmental hazards like floods or landslides can challenge their navigation skills, prompting quick thinking and teamwork.

## Airships and Unique Travel Options
In this world, traditional travel methods might not always be the most efficient. Players can discover unique travel options, such as airships, which offer new perspectives on their surroundings. However, these airships require resources and skills to operate, adding an element of adventure and exploration to their journey.

## Resting and Recovery
Rest is crucial for maintaining stamina during long treks. Players must carefully manage their time and resources to avoid exhaustion or burnout, particularly when exploring dangerous areas. Choosing the right moments to set up camp and rest can greatly affect their ability to face challenges ahead.
