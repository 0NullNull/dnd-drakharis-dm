# Vardak
Vardak is a desolate, war-torn continent where blood stains the very soil. Known for its rich natural resources, this land is a constant battleground, as mercenaries, warlords, and factions fight to control the land’s precious assets. With no central government, power shifts constantly between warlords, each of whom rises from the bloodied field of battle, only to be dethroned by another. The atmosphere in Vardak is grim, with the sounds of war echoing across its rugged terrain and the stench of blood lingering in the air.

Magic, much like in Glaciaris, is viewed as a tool for destruction and conquest. It is practiced with little regard for ethics, seen only as a means to win battles and gain power. In Vardak, corruption runs rampant—manifesting in the form of physical and psychological decay—borne from the unending wars and the endless suffering inflicted upon the land. Though daily life here is defined by war, survival is a constant struggle, as no one can trust anyone for long, and loyalty is always bought and sold.
