# Saharun 
To the south, the Sunscar Desert sprawls in an endless dance of shimmering dunes and scorching sun. Saharun is a land of extremes, where day brings searing heat and night cools to a comfortable embrace. The desert holds within its vast expanse oases of life, surrounded by ancient temples that stand as silent witnesses to a civilization long forgotten. Nomadic tribes traverse the sands, their stories woven into the fabric of the desertâ€™s history. As adventurers venture into Saharun, they uncover the secrets hidden beneath the dunes, facing both the beauty and danger that define this unforgiving land.
