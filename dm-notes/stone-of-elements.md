# Stone of Elements
***Artefact***
## Description:  
A palm-sized stone that shifts colors, representing the four elements, imbued with ancient elemental energy.  

## Effect:  
* While attuned to the Stone of Elements, the bearer can invoke the stone to cast Elemental Form to turn into an elemental of a chosen element once per day without material cost.
      
## Condition:  
* Each day at dawn, the bearer must choose one of the four elements (fire, water, earth, or air) to attune the stone to. If no element is attuned within an hour of dawn, the stone becomes a regular stone until the next dawn.
      
## Amplified Effects:  
* The effectiveness of the transformation is influenced by the environment; if used in an environment that aligns with the chosen element (e.g., near water for water form, near fire for fire form), the effects are amplified (e.g., additional damage or enhanced duration). Small features in the environment like a puddle of water or a campfire for example do not count towards the environment amplifying a certain element.
      
## Catastrophic Consequence:  
* If the stone is used in an inappropriate environment (like inside a building with no elemental features), a backlash occurs, causing an elemental explosion that deals 4d10 damage of the chosen element to the bearer and all creatures within a 30-foot radius. The type of damage corresponds to the element chosen at dawn.
      
## Curse:
* The bearer develops an elemental affinity that becomes a weakness; they are vulnerable to damage of the type corresponding to the last element they transformed into with the stone. This vulnerability lasts until the stone is used again or the curse is broken.
