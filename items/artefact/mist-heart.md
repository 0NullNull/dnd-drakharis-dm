# Heart of the Mist
## *Artefact* 
## Description
A smooth, shimmering gemstone that seems to pulse with a gentle light, echoing the essence of hidden wisdom.
## Effect
- While **attuned** to the Heart of the Mist, the bearer gains a **+2 bonus** to Intelligence **checks** and **saving throws**.
- *Once per day*, the bearer can cast the **Commune spell** without expending a spell slot, gaining profound wisdom and cryptic answers.

## Condition
- The bearer must be in a location of **great knowledge or mystical significance** to use the Commune spell effectively.

## Catastrophic Consequence
- If used outside of such locations, the answers may drive the bearer to **madness**, causing them to suffer **1d10 psychic** damage and temporarily reducing their Intelligence by **1d4** for *the rest of the day*.

## Curse
- The bearer becomes increasingly obsessed with knowledge. After each use of the Heart of the Mist, the bearer must succeed on a **DC 15** Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to seek out and hoard obscure knowledge, spending at least *1 hour per day* in research or study. **Failure** may lead to isolation from companions and an eventual loss of touch with **reality**.
