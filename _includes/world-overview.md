# World of Drakharis  
Welcome to a world of stunning landscapes and powerful magic, darkness lurks beneath the surface. Towering cities, magical forests, and floating islands grace the land, yet beneath the beauty lies a web of secrets, corruption, and forgotten horrors. Ancient forces shape the fate of this world, with ancient magic guarding some lands while others fall into chaos. Survival is never guaranteed, and in this land, you are never fully safe.

[Sylvaris](world/sylvaris), the heart of the world, is a continent of great contrast and beauty. Known for its vast and varied landscapes, it is a place where wild, untamed nature thrives alongside human settlements. From magical forests and sprawling plains to snow-capped northern mountains, [Sylvaris](world/sylvaris) is a land of enchantment. Though it is the most populous continent, with settlements and cultivated lands, much of it remains a place of pristine wilderness, leaving its natural beauty undisturbed. While not without its dangers, [Sylvaris](world/sylvaris) is still one of the safest lands, though more perilous than the tranquil [Shengdao](world/shengdao).
  
Nestled in the far north, [Glaciaris](world/glaciaris) is a frozen wasteland marked by an endless war between two nations, dividing the continent into battlegrounds. The landscape is harsh and unforgiving, where magic is a tool of war and survival is a daily struggle. Amidst the cold and conflict, corruption seeps into both the land and its people, and those who dare venture here must be prepared for the relentless forces of nature and mankind alike.
  
To the south, [Saharun](world/saharun) is a barren desert where only a few cities survive, clinging to life amid endless dunes. In the remnants of ancient civilizations, magic is both a tool and a secret. This land is dangerous, with bandits, pirates, and eldritch horrors lurking. Amidst the desolation, one coastal city stands as a mystery of prosperity.

In the west, [Vardak](world/vardak) is a continent where the earth is soaked in the blood of countless battles. Home to mercenaries and ruthless warlords, it is a land where power is constantly shifting, and survival depends on your strength in battle. Magic is wielded for war, and corruption seeps into every corner of this grim, desolate place. Here, the clash of steel and the scent of death never cease.

[Shengdao](world/shengdao) is a land of beauty and peace, where towering peaks and lush valleys seem to hold the world at bay. Protected by an ancient magic that has kept it safe for generations, the monks of Shengdao guard this land with dedication and wisdom. To the people, [Shengdao](world/shengdao) is a place of harmony—its tranquility unmarred by the struggles of the outside world.

To the northeast lies [Eldarheim](world/eldarheim), the smallest of the continents, yet perhaps the most insular. Ruled by a single kingdom of pureblooded elves and humans, it is a land of sharp lines and even sharper divisions. The people of [Eldarheim](world/eldarheim) pride themselves on their untainted lineage, and they view all other races with disdain, enforcing strict societal hierarchies to maintain their dominance. The cities here are grand, their architecture a testament to the kingdom’s ancient lineage, but beneath the beauty lies a simmering tension, as those who do not fit the kingdom’s strict ideals live in the shadows, oppressed and marginalized.  

The vast oceans separating the continents are dotted with ancient, mysterious islands, remnants of forgotten civilizations and strange, unexplained phenomena. These islands, often shrouded in mist, hold secrets long lost to time, with some whispering of eldritch horrors and others harboring untold riches. Their enigmatic nature calls to adventurers and explorers, promising discovery but also danger lurking in the unknown.

The world is a place of striking contrasts, where beauty and terror exist side by side. From the peaceful tranquility of Shengdao, where ancient magic keeps its people safe, to the war-torn plains of Vardak, soaked in blood and ruled by mercenary warlords, the landscape is shaped by the forces of nature, magic, and corruption. Each continent has its own story: Sylvaris, the heart of the world, teeming with life and untold secrets; Glaciaris, a frozen wasteland torn by an endless war; Saharun, a harsh desert hiding ancient ruins and eldritch influences; and Eldarheim, where beauty and tyranny are tightly entwined. Amidst this turmoil, the oceans are dotted with mysterious, ancient islands, holding secrets older than the world itself.

Will you risk it all to learn what lies beneath the surface, or destroy the world trying?
