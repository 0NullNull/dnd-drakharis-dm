## Horrors that Feed on Insanity
These creatures are manifestations of madness. They thrive on the psychological torment and deterioration of their victims. As the players become more insane, they inadvertently attract these beings, making insanity itself a dangerous resource. The more insane a character becomes, the more they risk being hunted or influenced by these horrors.

## Insanity as a Beacon:
The core mechanic for these creatures is that insanity serves as a beacon, attracting the eldritch horrors. The higher a character’s madness score, the more likely they are to encounter these creatures.

### Mechanics for Attracting Monsters:
Madness Threshold: Set a threshold where creatures begin to be drawn to the players. For example, for every 10 points of madness a player accumulates, there's a chance the horrors will manifest in the area.
* 1-9 Madness Points: The player may start to feel watched or hear whispers, but nothing physical occurs.
* 10-19 Madness Points: The player might start experiencing visions of the horrors or feel like they’re being followed.
* 20+ Madness Points: The horrors begin to materialize in the area, directly attacking or confronting the players.  
### Rising Danger:
The longer the player remains in an area or actively becomes more insane, the frequency of these encounters could increase. It could even be tied to specific locations (such as places filled with strong, otherworldly magic or the In-Between) where madness is more likely to accumulate.

## Specific Eldritch Horror Types That Feed on Madness:
These creatures can take many forms, depending on the type of madness they feed on. Here are a few ideas:

### The Mind Eater:
**Lore**: These creatures exist in a parallel space that is tied to the minds of the insane. They feed on mental anguish and paranoia, becoming stronger as their victims' minds deteriorate. The more a player becomes fractured mentally, the more the Mind Eater can enter their thoughts and haunt their dreams.  
**Abilities**: The Mind Eater can manifest as hallucinations, making players unable to trust their senses. When a player becomes insane enough, it can physically appear and attempt to consume their sanity. The Mind Eater might try to trap the player in a nightmarish version of reality, feeding off their fear and confusion.  
### The Screamer:
**Lore**: The Screamer thrives in environments of high psychic dissonance. It is drawn to places filled with chaos, screaming minds, and insane individuals. As players’ insanity grows, it becomes more audible in their surroundings, signaling its approach with mind-wrenching screams.  
**Abilities**: This entity can induce temporary madness in its victims simply by being near them, overwhelming them with auditory hallucinations and distorted emotions. The longer players are near it, the more disoriented and panicked they become, leading them into potential horrific situations. It might even pull players into traps made from their own madness.  
### The Whisperer in the Dark:
**Lore**: This creature is an ancient entity that feeds off the fear and anxiety caused by insanity. It is drawn to places where people’s mental states fray, slipping between the cracks in their minds to distort their perception of reality. The more insane a person becomes, the more the Whisperer can whisper into their thoughts, manipulating their actions.  
**Abilities**: As a player’s madness increases, the Whisperer’s whispers become clearer, and it may even begin guiding the player’s thoughts, leading them to dangerous choices. If the player becomes too far gone, the Whisperer can take full control of their body temporarily, making them act against their will.
