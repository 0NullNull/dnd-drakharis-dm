# Vilekin<br>The Hidden Empire of Shadows
A cunning, mutated race of ratlike humanoids that infest the sewers, ruins, and forgotten tunnels beneath civilization, the Vilekin are a shadowy force that operates unnoticed beneath the surface. Their existence is known only to those who dare venture into the dark, and even then, they are often dismissed as myth, plague, or urban legend. In truth, the Vilekin form a hidden empire, thriving through their black market syndicates, espionage networks, and influence over the criminal underworld.  
<br>

## Overview
The Vilekin are a scattered yet deeply connected network of ratfolk who thrive in the shadows of cities and forgotten places. Many rumors circulate about their origins. Some say they predates the cities above, while others believe they were created by a long-forgotten mage god of secrets or cursed into existence. Whatever the truth, the Vilekin are master manipulators of urban environments, controlling illegal trade, acting as information brokers, and undermining the structures of civilization from below.  
<br>

## Culture & Structure
The Vilekin society is structured into various Clans, each of which is led by a Whisperlord or Brood Matron. These leaders are the most powerful among their kind, ruling with a combination of cunning and terror. In times of upheaval or great opportunity, the most influential clan leaders meet in a secretive gathering known as the Council of Teeth.  
<br>

Their guiding philosophy is summed up by the Black Doctrine: "What is taken is earned. What is hidden is power."  
<br>

The Vilekin live by a rigid caste system, each role playing a critical part in their society:

* Whispers:<br> Espionage experts and messengers, trained from birth to memorize secrets and deliver coded messages.

* Stitchers:<br> Alchemists, plague-brewers, and flesh-shapers who deal with toxins, mutations, and forbidden arts.

* Fangs:<br> Elite assassins and enforcers skilled in stealth, poison, and guerrilla tactics.

* Scratcheyes:<br> Tinkerers, scrappers, and magitech scavengers who craft weapons from junk and reanimate the remains of the dead.

## The Underbelly Network
The Vilekin operate from a complex, ever-shifting network of underground warrens, tunnels, and hidden lairs beneath the cities they manipulate. Their stronghold lies in the forgotten depths—sewers, abandoned ruins, and deep labyrinths that few have ever seen.  
<br>

Key components of their network include:

* Tunnel-Warrens:<br> Winding corridors under cities filled with traps, illusions, and hidden passages. A labyrinth of danger that only the Vilekin know how to navigate.

* Rotmarkets:<br> Expansive black markets where stolen relics, cursed items, forbidden magic, and even living contraband are traded in the dark.

* The Deepchant:<br> A secretive system of communication that relies on tapping, echoes, and coded speech reverberating through pipes and walls.

Through these systems, the Vilekin control much of the illegal trade in major cities, acting as middlemen between thieves' guilds, rival factions, and darker entities. Their reach is vast, and their influence is often unseen but undeniable.

“*If you want to vanish a noble, sell a soul, or find a forgotten god’s tooth… you go to the Vilekin.*”

## [Gnarr'Kaan]({{"factions/gnarrkaan" | absolute_url}})<br>The Syndicate of Shadows
The Vilekin's most notorious creation is the Gnarr'Kaan, a criminal syndicate that has grown to become one of the most powerful and feared groups in the world. It began as a small network of Vilekin-controlled black markets and smuggling rings, but over time, it has expanded its influence, becoming a massive force in the underground world. The Gnarr'Kaan serves as the primary organization through which the Vilekin exert their power over cities, manipulating events and controlling trade through secrecy, cunning, and ruthlessness.  
<br>

Their influence is felt in almost every major city, and the syndicate has its tendrils deep in the political and economic systems, operating from the shadows and making deals with criminals, nobles, and mercenaries alike. Despite their power, the Gnarr'Kaan remain enigmatic, with their leaders hidden in the depths of the Vilekin’s labyrinthine underworld, known only to those who have risen to the highest echelons of the syndicate.
