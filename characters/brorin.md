    # Brorin Grimspark

    * "Don’t try to steal from that dwarf — his cart bites back."

    * Brorin’s shop looks like a battered old wagon to most folk, but those who know better say it’s a masterpiece of lost technologies and ancient magic. Some claim even the high artificers of Ironwood Citadel couldn’t fully unravel how it works — shifting from wagon to ship to sky-sled with barely a whisper of its hidden engines. Brorin guards its secrets tighter than his own beard.

Gruff, sharp-eyed, and endlessly suspicious, Brorin Grimspark is a name whispered among those who deal in rare and dangerous artifacts. With a thick white beard braided in old dwarven style and hands hardened from a lifetime of tinkering, he travels the world in his legendary shop-wagon — a marvel of hidden technology that can shift forms at will. Brorin holds loyalty dear but grudges even dearer.

Few have earned his full trust, but those who do find in him an unmatched craftsman and a stubborn ally. Where Brorin goes, trouble — and opportunity — often follows.
