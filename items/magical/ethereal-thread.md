## Ethereal Thread
*Wondrous item,* <strong style="color: green"><em>rare</em></strong>  
This nearly invisible spool of thread seems to shimmer faintly, its true form almost imperceptible to the naked eye. Only through magical means can its presence be detected. The thread pulses with ethereal energy, able to slip through walls with ease.

### **Properties**:

* **Attaching the Thread**: <br>
As an action, you must touch a creature within 5 feet to attach the Ethereal Thread to it. Once attached, the thread becomes ethereal and can pass through walls, ceilings, and other obstacles, stretching seemingly indefinitely.

* **Move Your Consciousness**: <br>
While concentrating, your consciousness shifts into the creature to which the thread is attached, allowing you to perceive the world as if you were the creature. You experience all the creature’s senses—sight, sound, touch, and smell—but only while concentrating. While you are concentrating on the thread, you become incapacitated. You cannot take actions or reactions, and your awareness is limited to the creature’s senses. This effect lasts for 1 hour or until the thread is severed or your concentration is broken.

* **Sensing Beyond 100 Feet**: <br>
While within 100 feet of the creature, you can fully transfer your consciousness into it, perceiving the world as if you were the creature. Beyond 100 feet, the connection weakens and you can no longer transfer your consciousness into the creature. Instead, you can only vaguely sense its location, becoming less precise the further away it is.

* **Severing the Thread**: <br>
The thread lasts for 1 hour or until the creature is slain or the connection is intentionally severed. The thread can be severed by either the creature (if aware of the thread) or the user. Severing the thread requires a bonus action. Once severed, the effect ends immediately, and you are no longer incapacitated.

* **Ethereal Visibility**: <br>
The thread is almost invisible to the naked eye, but it can be seen through magical means such as true sight or detect magic. Additionally, in the Ethereal Plane, the thread glows brightly and can be easily traced to its origin, revealing the user’s location and their connection to the creature.
