# Glaciaris 
In the frigid north lies Glaciaris, a land of towering peaks and icy fjords, where the sun rarely pierces the perpetual blanket of snow. The echoes of ancient civilizations linger beneath the glaciers, whispering tales of magic and mystery. Tundra stretches endlessly, a harsh yet beautiful realm where only the hardiest creatures thrive. Here, adventurers brave the cold, seeking the fabled ruins that promise untold treasures and lost knowledge buried beneath the ice. The Frostbound Expanse is a realm of both peril and wonder, where the chill of the wind carries the secrets of the ages.
