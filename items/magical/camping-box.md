## Camping Box
*Wondrous item,* <strong style="color: lightblue"><em>uncommon</em></strong>

This small, sturdy wooden box (roughly the size of a backpack) hums with a faint magical warmth. As an action, a creature can place the box on the ground and speak its command word. Over the course of 1 minute, the box unfolds and expands into a cozy, weatherproof hut large enough to comfortably house up to four Medium or smaller creatures.

### **Inside, the hut features**:

* Comfortable bedrolls for each occupant

* A small fire pit (magically smokeless and self-igniting)

* Magical insulation that maintains a comfortable interior temperature, regardless of external weather conditions

The hut remains until the command word is spoken again within 5 feet of it, at which point it folds back into its box form over 1 minute.

### **Limitations**:

* The hut is stationary once deployed and cannot move.

* The hut provides no special protection against magical effects, enemies, or siege damage.

* Setting up or packing up the hut takes 1 uninterrupted minute.

### **Notes**:

* If the hut is destroyed, the box is ruined and loses its magic.
